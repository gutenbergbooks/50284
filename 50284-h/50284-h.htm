<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p>On the corner of one of the principal thoroughfares,
in a very large city, there was located,
fifteen years ago, a small grocery store. In front
of the building the enterprising owner displayed
fruits, vegetables and other goods; articles that
were particularly tempting to boys.</p>

<p>In a near-by cottage there lived a very bright
boy, twelve years of age, and familiarly known
to every one in the neighborhood, as Jimmy, the
newsboy. And that meant a bad boy.</p>

<p>On the disappearance of an occasional apple,
an orange, or if one of the fruit-stands was upset,
it was declared that Jimmy did it. All fights
around the corner originated from Jimmy.</p>

<p>So bad was this boy’s reputation that every
one in the ward, including several Sunday-school
teachers, was kept busy looking for a favorable
opportunity to give Jimmy, what they thought he
deserved, “a good licking.”</p>

<p>The groceryman was not slow in letting his
customers know how bad Jimmy was.</p>

<p>He was kicked, lectured, preached to, and a
dozen times a day was pushed off the corner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>He was abused because he annoyed men and
women by his misbehavior.</p>

<p>No one ever stopped to ask this boy where he
lived; what about his parents, his home life, or to
see if there was really any good in him worth trying
to develop. The bad was visible, and the
people seemed to delight in their vain efforts to
correct him by censures and kicks.</p>

<p>There was no question about Jimmy being
bad, about as bad as any street-boy would become
who had his own way, and, whose parents permitted
him to go and come when he pleased, and to
associate with bad company, particularly boys
older than he was.</p>

<p>Jimmy was a leader of a gang of little toughs
who always met at the corner, in the evenings,
and delighted in making it unpleasant for those
who lived within hearing distance. He was
strong, quick, and could throw to the ground any
boy of his size, and never hesitated trying a
much larger boy. He was the terror of the corners.</p>

<p>Yet with all his bad reputation, no one ever
caught him doing anything for which he could
be punished under the state laws.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>Circumstantial evidence was all the groceryman
could produce at any time he was accused.
The boy who “squealed” to the groceryman about
Jimmy had to remain away from the corner until
he thought that Jimmy had forgotten it.</p>

<p>Jimmy was a typical newsboy.</p>

<p>He was not happy in fine clothes. He did not
use the many slang phrases which so frequently
become a part of a street-boy’s life and enjoyment,
but he had everything else.</p>

<p>He had a small route, perhaps thirty customers,
for morning and evening papers, and when
he had delivered his papers, he would hasten
down town, get a new supply of the latest editions,
and join the boys in selling on the streets.</p>

<p>He was an early riser, like all carriers, and
long before the neighbors thought of getting up
he was out on the street, and in all kinds of
weather.</p>

<p>The station agent from whom he procured
his morning papers said: “There is not a more
faithful boy in the city, from a business view.
But he has to be served first. He has a way of
his own in pushing ahead of the crowd and is always
among the first on his route. He pays cash
for what he gets, but still, he is a bad boy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>A gentleman who lived in the neighborhood,
and frequently called at the grocery store, became
interested in Jimmy. There was something
naturally attractive about the boy. There was
a twinkle of his black eyes that was really fascinating.</p>

<p>“I would like to see what is back of that activity,”
said the gentleman, one day to the groceryman.</p>

<p>One afternoon, late in the fall, the gentleman
was standing on the corner waiting for a car
when the groceryman called him.</p>

<p>“You said you would like to see what Jimmy,
the newsboy, was made of. He is up to some
mischief now. He just bought a sack of hickory-nuts,
and I’ll bet a cooky he is making some one
unhappy.”</p>

<p>Two blocks away was a large lot, with a high
fence around it. Scattered about the lot were a
dozen or more hickory trees. The gentleman saw
Jimmy climb the fence, walk to the farther side
of the lot, and when under a heavy foliaged tree
he stood for some moments looking in every direction.
Finally he began to scatter hickory-nuts
under the tree. Very carefully seeing that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
were dropped all around this particular tree.
Sometimes he would take a handful of leaves and
cover over a lot of nuts. To the gentleman this
was an unusual transaction, so he walked around
to the big gate and followed a path across the
heavy grass, and went to Jimmy.</p>

<p>“I have a curiosity to know what you are
doing,” said the gentleman, “and if you have no
objections I would like to have you tell me.”</p>

<p>Jimmy took him by the hand, that he might
hasten towards the sidewalk, and when away
from the tree, he said.</p>

<p>“You see, mister, termorrow is Saturday.
There’s no school. Across the street lives a whole
lot of little boys and girls, and some of the boys
don’t like me very well, but that doesn’t cut any
figure with me. They comes over here every day
after school and particularly on Saturday and
hunt for hickory-nuts; but these old trees don’t
bear any more; they’s dead. But that one over
there, with the leaves, sometimes has hickory-nuts,
but this year nary a nut is on the old tree.
So I bought these here nuts an’ scattered ’em all
around the ground, an’ termorrow I’ll sneak
around the fence and watch the girls an’ boys
gather them. Won’t they be happy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>“I should think they would,” replied the man.</p>

<p>“They are real hickory-nuts, too,” added
Jimmy, “I blowed in fifteen cents at our grocery
store. If you want to you may come termorrow
an’ I will guarantee you will see the happiest
bunch ever gathered under a hickory-nut tree.
Will you come?”</p>

<p>“Well, I should be delighted to come; and I
will be there before you will,” replied the gentleman
kindly.</p>

<p>“You see,” said Jimmy, “I cannot come until
I deliver all my papers, an’ that’ll be about
eight o’clock. If you get there before I do, don’t
you ever tell who put the nuts under the tree, will
you?”</p>

<p>“I promise you, Jimmy, I will not only keep
it to myself, but I will not even go on the lot, until
you come.”</p>

<p>A few words about Jimmy and his home, and
they parted as friends.</p>

<p>“Under the hickory-nut tree termorrow
there’ll be a dozen happy girls an’ boys, an’ some
of the boys don’t like me,” rang in the ears of the
gentleman all during the evening and frequently
in the night.</p>

<p>What a sermon, sowing and reaping.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p>Saturday morning was an ideal autumn day;
a day children delighted to go into the woods
after hickory-nuts.</p>

<p>A few moments before eight o’clock the gentleman
was slowly walking around the great lot
when he saw Jimmy running at full speed down
the street towards him.</p>

<p>Under the great trees were a dozen little boys
and girls, and the air was filled with their merry
laughter as they excitedly gathered into their baskets
the hickory-nuts that Jimmy had so kindly
dropped for their pleasure and happiness.</p>

<p>“They tell me, Jimmy, you’re a bad boy,” said
the gentleman as they sat on a stump of a tree, in
sight of the children.</p>

<p>Jimmy made no reply.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t care what any one says,” added
the gentleman, “I don’t believe it. Your little
act with the hickory-nuts has taught me a lesson
I never learned in books. No boy would do that
unless he has some good qualities in him. I feel
honored to have this privilege of seeing those children
so happy this morning, and to think who did
all this. Jimmy,” and he took his little hand in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
his, “I want you to make me a promise&mdash;I want
you always to be my friend. What do you say?”</p>

<p>This was something Jimmy never heard of
before. He was accustomed to being kicked, and
censured, and for a man to ask him to be a friend
was, what he afterwards called, “a new deal.”</p>

<p>“Sure thing, I will,” he said frankly.</p>

<p>“Now I want you to come down to my office,
Monday after school, and we will talk over something
that I want you to do for me.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be there,” replied Jimmy, and after a
moments thought he asked.</p>

<p>“And can I bring some of my friends with
me?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, that is exactly what I want you
to do. Bring your gang, all your friends, particularly
the little toughs, and when you come into
my office don’t let any one stop you from seeing
me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t be afeared o’that, we knows as
how to get there.”</p>

<p>A few other things were talked about and
they separated for the day.</p>

<p>As the gentleman rode down town he thought
of the events of the morning, of the life of a newsboy.
These little wiry, nervous street boys, alert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
of eye, and lithe of limb, who flock the principal
thoroughfares of our great cities at almost all
hours of the day.</p>

<p>Newsboys and bootblacks, boys whom the
world seems to have forgotten. By peculiar conditions
these boys are used to being at odds with
the world. It need not be told that our newsboys,
as a general rule, as people know them, are regarded
as a swearing, stealing, lying, dishonest
lot of young criminals, and these qualifications
are recognized adjuncts to their business. With
these conditions is it not a wonder that any of
them ever succeed in working their way into the
ranks of respectibility? People who curse and
kick them, as they did Jimmy, never stop to think
that these neglected newsboys, of today, sharp,
shrewd and keen, may be the thieves, the burglars,
the highwaymen; or the successful patriotic
citizens of tomorrow.</p>

<p>No one will dispute the fact that, the street-boy
is surrounded on every hand by degraded and
vicious men, with drunkenness regarded as a
desirable condition, and the indulgence in drink
only limited by the ability to procure it.</p>

<p>Among many, robbery is regarded as a fine
art, and the tribute of praise bestowed upon rascality.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
If christian people do not find time, amid
the rush and roar of the city, in their mighty
struggle for wealth, to lend a hand to lead him
out on the highway of honest success, what is to
become of the street-boy?</p>

<p>Is it not true that many a boy is bad because
the best part of him was never developed?</p>

<p>It is not that a newsboy is so much worse than
other boys, but simply that the other half of him
didn’t get a chance.</p>

<p>If you, dear reader, will take time to get into
the real life of a boy, as the gentleman did with
Jimmy, you will be surprised, as he was, at what
you will discover. How quick he is to see an opportunity
to do something bad, and when discovered,
his conscience brings the blush of shame to his
cheeks. Take boys like Jimmy, the leader of a
gang of toughs, his acts on the public highway,
his language, his ragged clothes all indicating neglect
and evil designs, yet get his friendship, his
confidence, and he will prove, as did Jimmy, the
best and most faithful friend you ever had, not
only in his youth, in his teens, but long after you
have forgotten him.</p>

<p>No matter how bad the boy is, how miserable
his environment, that great spark of good, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
something, no one can explain its power, its influence,
is still there. To get into touch with that
life, to draw out the goodness of heart and make
it a tangible blessing to the boys of our land, is
the work every man and woman ought to try to
do. It was this object the gentleman had in asking
Jimmy and his friends to meet at his office.
He felt that opportunities of this nature come but
once in a life time.</p>

<p>George Eliot wrote: “The golden moments
in the stream of life rush past us and we see nothing
but sand. The angels come to visit us and
we only know them when they are gone. How
shall we live so as at the end to have done the
most for others and make the most of ourselves.”
We become good ourselves only in the measure
that we do good to some other soul. In Jimmy,
the newsboy, no one stopped to see what was
sleeping under the cover of extreme mischievousness.
They were always looking for bad and
they found it. Neglect is the mother of more calamities
than any other sin, and who are neglected
more than the newsboys?</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p>On the following Monday morning, at the
appointed, hour, Jimmy, with eight other boys,
was at the office of his newly-made friend.</p>

<p>It was an interesting picture, an exciting
scene.</p>

<p>Noisy, loud talking, several answering questions
at the same time, some turning over books,
papers, investigating everything in sight. Sharp,
shrewd, busy at every moment, quick to answer
any question and the replies always satisfactory,
and to the point.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know anything,” said Jimmy to
a friend, who was trying to investigate how a
typewriter was made, “let that meechine alone.”</p>

<p>It was soon in evidence that Jimmy’s word
meant something, for each boy obeyed him without
saying a word, except a little grunt of dissatisfaction,
to show he hated to obey. Not one
of the eight boys had clean hands. Not one a
coat with a button. Three safety-pins held holding
positions in some of their coats. Not one used
a handkerchief, and the slang would puzzle many
a lawyer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>As one of the boys lost his cap he said: “Some
kid five-fingered it.&mdash;took it with his hand.” It
was an interesting crowd.</p>

<p>“Well, you are on time, Jimmy, and I see you
have brought some of your friends with you,”
said the gentleman.</p>

<p>“These is part of de gang,” said Jimmy.</p>

<p>“Do you boys all want to be my friends, just
the same as Jimmy is?”</p>

<p>They replied, “Sure thing; cert. Yes’m.”</p>

<p>These friendly words brought the gang closer
to the gentleman’s desk. And more papers were
disturbed. The ink was investigated and one of
the boys wanted to know why it wasn’t red ink.
Another poked his finger in the ink stand and
made black streaks down the smallest boy’s face.
The gentleman was shown quite a number of
articles they had in their pockets. Nails, buttons,
marbles, pieces of slate-pencils, etc., all of which
had to be admired.</p>

<p>“Say, you, mister,” said a nine-year-old dirty-faced,
bright-eyed boy, “I had trouble gittin’ here.
De con. wus onto me an’ I had to take two lines
’fore I rode into de office wid out blowin’ in a
cent.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, quit your wasting words,” said Jimmy.</p>

<p>The boys gathered around the gentleman, and
he said:</p>

<p>“My! what good you boys can do in this world
with all of your push, and energy, your hustling,
your good health, you boys can turn up something,
and I’m going to help you do it. How
would you like to help me make all the men and
women who buy papers of you learn to love you.
Learn to speak kindly to you?”</p>

<p>“Aw, de peoples don’t care fur us.” said a boy
Jimmy called “Indian.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know about that. There is one
thing certain there can be no harm in trying.
The trouble is, people don’t know you, and you
won’t let them get acquainted with you. Let’s
make a start. First, I want to know if every one
of you wants to be a friend of mine? You do,
that’s a good start. And whenever you see me
on the street, it doesn’t make any difference what
I am doing, or who I am talking to, will you come
to me and say, good morning or good evening?”
They all agreed.</p>

<p>“And another thing, when you boys are down
town and should you hurt yourself, or get into
some trouble, lose your papers, your money, or
some one frightens you, I want you to call on me,
and I will try to help you. Notice, I say when
you are in trouble, because when you are doing
well and everything comes your way, you need no
assistance. You can take care of yourselves.
What do you say, boys, to this?”</p>

<p>They all promised and were glad of the opportunity.</p>

<p>This was the first intimate talk with the gang.</p>

<p>Two days later, while the gentleman was very
busy in his office, into the room came one of the
little visitors followed by some of the gang, he
was limping and crying as if his heart would
break. He paid no attention to any one in the
office but made directly for the gentleman, who
seeing him, excused himself from his business
friends and said to the boy,</p>

<p>“Well, now, what has happened to you?”</p>

<p>“A man shoved me off de sidewalk into de
gutter and me foot struck a piece of glass,” he replied,
between sobs. His foot was bloody, and
the more blood he saw the louder became his
cries. He was taken into a near-by hotel, his
foot carefully washed, a handkerchief tied over
the wound, his tears wiped away, and when back
into the office he said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“I thank you, sir.”</p>

<p>He picked up his bundle of papers, all pain
had disappeared, the smiles again came to his
pretty face, and with his friends, left the office,
singing a popular air.</p>

<p>The result of this little act of duty added fifty
new friends.</p>

<p>A week later, a little colored boy entered the
office crying. He was known on the street as
Midnight.</p>

<p>“Tree boys trowed me down in de alley, an’
swiped me papers.”</p>

<p>Four boys came with him. They wondered
what would be done. While talking with him,
Jimmy dropped in. Not quietly but made everybody
get out of the way.</p>

<p>“I know the three kids,” said Jimmy, “and
I’ll go after them.”</p>

<p>So Jimmy left on his own accord. In fifteen
minutes he returned bringing two boys.</p>

<p>“There, you kids,” he said, “give Midnight
back his money fur de papers you stole.”</p>

<p>It was done. Midnight’s eyes resumed their
natural brightness, and he left happy, thankful
to Jimmy for his interest.</p>

<p>To the gentleman this was a revelation. The
power one boy can have over a gang of boys
ought to be used for good. Such vital energy,
such quick action, such nerve and endurance, all
this must be used for doing good, for helping each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
other. My! what a boy who has influence among
his fellow companions, can do. If each boy could
be placed on his honor, each boy aiming to do the
best he can to uplift his associate, trying to correct
the little evils from which spring so many
crimes, how much happiness, how many useful
lives would result. If men would try to instill
into the young hearts of our boys, our newsboys,
because they are tempted more than any other
class, a spirit of trust and love, instead of a spirit
of fear and hate and revenge, what a happy unselfish
world we would have. Suppose these
newsboys, the boys who are so often accused of
being bad, would be treated as Christ treated
wrong-doers, not as criminals, but as misdirected
and misguided boys, putting everything in their
way to encourage them to do right. Suppose
they were warned of danger, were propped up
when about to fall, and personal efforts were
made to find the good in each boy and to cultivate
it as a husbandman would his garden&mdash;pulling
out and destroying the weeds, removing the
germs of disorder, and keeping a watchful eye
over all even until the ripening of the fruit.
What would be the result? The gentleman gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the subject considerable thought and concluded
to try the experiment.</p>

<p>From the material at command it was surprising
how many little good things sprung up
where least expected and from soil considered as
absolutely worthless. Like some products of the
garden, good came from unexpected places.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of conditions and circumstances,
the number of friends increased so
rapidly that when cold weather set in, over a
hundred little hustling friends of the street were
added to the list.</p>

<p>Winter came with snow and ice and cold
winds, making it hard for the carriers to deliver
their papers before the breakfast hour. The little
sellers were heard only a short time after the
newspaper editions were out, and they were compelled
to seek warm places. It was noticeable
that the saloons of the city were the only places
open to these boys seeking shelter and warmth.</p>

<p>There were several gentlemen in the city
heartily in sympathy with the new movement
among the newsboys, and among them was a generous
clothier who presented, through the gentleman,
fifty overcoats to be given to the poorest
newsboys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>To select fifty of the most deserving, for the
entire hundred were in want, was a very difficult
task, especially as those interested had but little
experience with boys of the street.</p>

<p>But Jimmy came to the rescue and he and the
gentleman began to deliver the coats. When
forty-five coats were given there remained twenty
boys who were equally as needy as the others and
there were but five coats left. How to select five
boys from this number was the question.</p>

<p>Jimmy accomplished it.</p>

<p>The next day the gentleman was asked to go
into the alley in the rear of the post-office where
he met about sixty boys. Twenty of the poorest,
those whose names were booked for coats, were
asked to “stand in line against the building.”
Jimmy asked them to name five of their number
who were very poor.</p>

<p>“You see, Kids,” said Jimmy, “we have only
five coats and if you select the five boys needing
them it is all right.”</p>

<p>The boys quickly named the lucky sellers.</p>

<p>Midnight, Peanuts, Bluster, Swipsey and
Bundle were unanimously chosen and the orders
were given to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>This was a great surprise to the gentleman,
for what he had imagined would be a difficult
problem was satisfactorily settled in a very few
moments by the boys.</p>

<p>“Boys, come close to me,” said the gentleman.
It was difficult for him to stand as they crowded
so closely around him.</p>

<p>“I am surprised at your way of doing business.
This is one of the greatest things I ever
saw. It shows you boys can take care of yourselves
and I believe you could manage worse
things than dividing up a lot of coats. For this
nice little act of yours I am going to give you a
first-class Christmas dinner&mdash;”</p>

<p>Not another word could be heard. That
quiet, listening bunch of boys was quickly
changed to a turbulent, noisy crowd.</p>

<p>Several policeman came into the alley to see
the cause of the noise. It wasn’t common everyday
cheering, but yelling. The invitation was accepted&mdash;it
seemed by a thousand voices.</p>

<p>“All right, boys, get your little friends and
meet me at the post-office steps Christmas morning
at eleven o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Say, Mister,” said Swipsey, a bootblack,
“only sellers and bootblacks in this deal?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, only sellers and bootblacks this time,
and I don’t want a good boy in the crowd. I
want only boys who are bad. I want all the gang
and their friends. I want poor boys, but they
must all be newsboys. That is, they must sell
papers or shine shoes, and not a boy must come
in dress suit.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p>Christmas morning came without a cloud in
sight. The sun was warm. It was an ideal
Christmas day. The boys were to meet at eleven
o’clock, but fifty newsies were playing around the
corners of the post-office as early as seven o’clock
and at ten o’clock they came in groups of five and
ten from every direction. When the gentleman
appeared he was considerably embarrassed at the
noisy reception. The boys formed in line by twos
and as the hundred and fifty marched down the
street yelling at the tops of their voices the good
people of the city stood on the sidewalks wondering
what had broken loose. The boys when near
their destination, arriving at the top of a hill,
without warning made a break for the bottom,
like a flock of sheep scattering down a hill. They
ran screaming as only boys can. At the door of
the building, where they were to have their
Christmas dinner, they were met by six policemen,
who held them at bay, requiring them to go
up stairs single file.</p>

<p>The tables presented a sight that even grown
people considered, “one of the most attractive layouts
ever seen in the city.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Flowers, fruit of all kinds, with “a mountain
of turkey” and candy “to burn,” greeted the boys.
In just five minutes after the newsies were seated
there was not an orange, an apple, a banana or
a piece of candy in sight. All disappeared as if
by magic. Ice cream and pie were first to receive
attention. Turkey and chicken were later
in demand. In half an hour the tables were
cleared of everything that looked good to eat.
Not only were the pockets of the boys filled with
oranges and apples but their shirt-waists and
pant-legs were bulged out with the things that
pleased them most. Only six fights were recorded
worthy of notice.</p>

<p>An entertainment followed the dinner. It was
the kind and character they could understand and
appreciate. Interesting and earnest talks by
newspaper representatives, were sandwiched between
acts. The object of the gathering was well
defined by the members of the press. Their gentleman
friend wanted the sellers and bootblacks
to start a Newsboys’ Association. This was received
with the usual noisy approval. He wanted
an association which the boys themselves would
run; make their own laws, elect from their own
numbers the officers, and everything connected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
with the running of the association to be under
their supervision. On that Christmas day one
hundred and two boys were enrolled in the new
association, and their gentleman friend elected
president, with Jimmy as vice-president.</p>

<p>The president was requested “to get busy,”
and, “prepare rules an’ such things as we can
work by.”</p>

<p>After this meeting, Jimmy’s friend was
known as “Mr. President.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p>A dozen or more newsboys can be seen at almost
any hour of the day, dodging here and there
around the corners, down alleys, or playing in the
rear of the circulating offices of the great dailies.
In all kinds of weather they will be found at their
posts, prompt in delivering their papers to subscribers,
or upon the streets crying the most important
of the many head lines of the transactions
of a day. Would it be possible to get this noisy,
hustling crowd of boys together and gradually to
bring this great power, this great force, into a
channel for doing good? To form an association
where the boy would be “de whole thing” with
only the hand of man to guide where it was
necessary? To simply push the button? In
short, would it result in doing good among the
class of boys who are neglected in more ways
than men and women imagine? Reflection
resulted in adopting a name that would imply
everything&mdash;</p>

<p>“Boyville.”</p>

<p>It means work with and among newsboys by
the boys themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>The Boyville Newsboys’ Association.</p>

<p>It was at once organized, and in its preamble
of incorporation was written the Golden Rule.
In the formation of Boyville it must not be understood
that its mission was to draw good boys
from good homes; but rather to give help to bad
boys, come from where they may, when they appear
on the streets&mdash;away from home influences.
Whether they come from the most palatial residences
on the shaded avenues, or from the
crowded hovels of alleys, from poorly kept tenements,
or even those who are compelled to sleep
in public stairways, barns, or wherever a boy can
creep under shelter without being noticed.</p>

<p>With one hundred and fifty-two newsboys,
sellers and bootblacks, enrolled as active members
for life; with an unwritten constitution and laws
that were made to suit conditions, and that were
subject to change at every meeting; with meeting
places in alleys, in vacant store-rooms, theatres
or wherever boys could meet on short notice,
Boyville was started. Trustees were chosen from
newspaper representatives, and leading citizens,
but the detail work, the real work among the
boys, was placed in the hands of the president&mdash;to
make a success or failure of the project. It
was first found necessary that the president
should keep in personal daily touch with every
boy, not in bunches but each boy, sellers and bootblacks.
A membership card was issued. This
card simply let the public know the bearer was a
member of Boyville, Newsboys’ Association. For
this, and all benefits of the association, the boy
paid nothing in money. No assessments of any
kind. Nothing that would permit even a donation.
He was simply required to obey the rules&mdash;not
to swear, to steal, to play craps, a game so
common among sellers, or smoke cirgarettes.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>There were but three officers, the president,
vice-president and secretary. The two latter,
newsboys. Jimmy the newsboy, and Johnny the
bootblack, both leaders of gangs. These two boys
were told that the success of the association depended
entirely on their work. They had charge
of the one hundred and fifty-two members. Their
first orders were: “that each boy must watch the
other boys and correct a fellow member for doing
anything that would disgrace the association.
They must not wait to see an officer to punish a
member for stealing, swearing or playin’ o’craps.
They must not depend on what they heard, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
on what they saw. Take the law into their own
hands, and punish on the spot.”</p>

<p>The end of the first month found twenty-eight
membership cards taken from boys who had
violated the rule, “you must not steal,” and nine
taken from boys who smoked cigarettes. The
fines were from five to fifteen days. When the
fines numbered fifty membership cards, the president
made arrangements with a theatre to admit
the members, permitting no boy to enter unless he
showed his membership card. The boys who
were fined, and did not have their cards, were
dealt a pretty heavy blow, for boys. A little banquet
was given and again no boy admitted to the
hall without showing his card. This occasional
hit had its effect in reducing the cards in the
hands of the president to an average of about ten
a month.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p>The membership increased so rapidly and the
detail work became so extended, that it was found
necessary to increase the number of officers, from
two boys to eleven. The constitution and by-laws
provided a Central Association, which was officered
by boys who had experience upon the
streets, as sellers and carriers. The vice-president
gradually became familiar with the objects
of the association, and the work among the boys.
He was a typical newsboy, a good street-seller
and his power was felt among the boys, especially
those who were inclined to be bad. A secretary
was elected from the ranks of the carriers.
He was a good worker. The treasurer was a
boy who received the unanimous vote of the association.
The money he received was small donations,
from benevolently-inclined friends. This
was used for purchasing flowers for sick boys,
etc. The real work of the association depended upon
the executive committee of five members. Like
most organizations, the committee-work centered
in the chairman. The chairman of this committee
proved to be one of the most active and faithful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
boys of the association. He left nothing undone
in his efforts to unravel a difficulty or in correcting
and building up a boy who had done
wrong. The four boys on his committee were untiring
in their efforts for the success of the association.
This committee was in constant touch
with the president.</p>

<p>The membership committee of three boys
looked after old as well as new members. Each
applicant had to be submitted to them for approval.</p>

<p>With these eleven officers, all boys under fourteen,
the association began life. The constitution
and by-laws embraced in its power and force simply
one aim, one object, to do good among the
boys. To do it effectively, and make the results
lasting. To build up, never pull down; to encourage
honesty, to watch and warn a boy.</p>

<p>The work among the street boys became more
interesting as the months rolled on, and, at the
end of a year the membership of Boyville had increased
to two hundred and fifty sellers and bootblacks.
This number not only included boys who
sold papers every day, but those who sold extras,
and on Saturdays, and special occasions, and boys
who sold magazines or other periodicals. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
association began to grow and become recognized
by the boys generally, and new sellers appeared
upon the streets daily, all anxious to join. The
working officers remained the same&mdash;but two
boys doing the detail work.</p>

<p>Two years passed under the new officers and
rules. The Boyville Newsboys’ Association began
to be felt in the community. Compliments
were frequent concerning the good work. The
association had increased its membership to fifteen
hundred and twenty boys. A little army,
and all working harmoniously together for each
others good, and in trying to assist and build up
the association. Doubting men and women, and
the world is full of them, were perfectly satisfied
of the success of the boys governing themselves,
as was shown almost daily in the work. The boys
solved a problem never thought of being tried by
men and women who had long experience in
working among boys.</p>

<p>The success of Boyville increased in proportion
to the work done by the young officers.</p>

<p>People began to look upon a newsboy with
some consideration, and as a necessary adjunct
to the growth of a city. His politeness, his honesty,
his general deportment attracted special notice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
and the boys received many kind words and
increased attention.</p>

<p>The association began to assume such magnitude
that it was found necessary to divide it
into auxiliaries, to get a suitable badge, and a
membership card defining more explicitly certain
rules.</p>

<p>Boyville was therefore divided into five auxiliaries&mdash;the
sellers, north, south, east and west
branches, with the constitution of the Central.
Each auxiliary had eleven officers, making a total
of sixty-six officers&mdash;all boys. In the annual
election of officers great interest was taken by
the boys, many displaying political “wire pulling”
qualifications that would equal the work done by
great political bodies.</p>

<p>These sixty-six officers were scattered in all
parts of the city, making it almost impossible for
a boy whom they wanted for violating a rule of
the association, to escape their notice.</p>

<p>The membership card told the story of what
was expected of a member. It is herewith given
for that purpose.</p>

The Boyville Newsboys’ Association. He does not approve
of swearing, lying, stealing, gambling, drinking
intoxicating liquors, or smoking cigarettes, and is entitled
to all the benefits of said association, and the respect
and esteem of the public.</p>
<p class="pr4">Signed by the officers.</p>
</div>

<p class="p1">With these rules, and simple pledge, if pledge
it can be called, in the hands of each newsboy,
the reader can imagine the good that must result.</p>

<p>It does not say the holder is guilty of any of
these evils, neither does it imply that he must not
swear, etc., but it does say, and each boy is
strongly impressed with the fact, that he does not
approve of these things, and will not permit a
fellow member to violate a single rule.</p>

<p>A boy who says I do not believe in swearing,
while he may swear himself, will take great pleasure
in checking some one else, and often bumps
up against a strong proposition when he finds
some other boy, probably of greater strength,
watching him, and waiting anxiously for an opportunity
to correct him. If not corrected with
a simple warning it may end in a fight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>A boy makes an application for membership.
He is recommended by a friend. He is approved
by the membership committee. In case there is
something wrong with the applicant, particularly
if he steals, or swears, or smokes cigarettes, he
is sent with a note to the president, or as is more
frequently done, one of the officers reports in
person giving the president a history of the applicant
and the failing he has.</p>

<p>The new member knows nothing of this, in
fact he gives expression to his thoughts and says,
after he receives his credentials, “It’s dead easy.”
It is, as far as the business he has with the president,
but the moment he leaves the president’s
office, the officers living in his district are notified
of the trouble this boy gives, or bad habit he delights
in keeping up.</p>

<p>Even the boys with whom he associates become
familiar, through methods of their own,
with his failings, and go after him with all the
authority of an official.</p>

<p>With all the interest taken by the boys to correct
a member for violating one of the rules, and
the severe methods adopted by them to correct a
known evil, it is seldom a boy will appear against
one of his associates as a witness.</p>

<p>A gentleman whose sympathy was with the
work, brought a boy to the president whom he
accused of using language, “unbecoming a criminal.”
As witnesses he brought with him four
newsboy companions.</p>

<p>Imagine the gentleman’s surprise to hear the
boys say: “Mister, you’re dreaming through a
pipe. He didn’t swear.” The boys did not even
show signs of embarrassment but faced the
charge with perfect ease. No argument could
get the boys to testify against their friend.</p>

<p>The gentleman left disgusted with newsboys.</p>

<p>“I will let you boys settle this among yourselves,”
said the president.</p>

<p>They went upon the street, into the alley.
Half an hour later the newsboy accused of swearing
returned. Timidly he approached the president
and said.</p>

<p>“I swore but I will never do it again, and I
mean it, I am sorry.”</p>

<p>At the door the president saw four little faces
peeping through the window. They were watching
their friend.</p>

<p>“Where is your badge?” asked the president.</p>

<p>“The boys took it from me, they’re out there,”
he replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>They were beckoned to come in.</p>

<p>“Did you do the right thing?” one of the boys
asked the accused.</p>

<p>“Yes, didn’t I Mr. President?” he answered,
looking for sympathy.</p>

<p>“Yes, boys, he is all right. I understand
everything,” said the president.</p>

<p>The badge was returned to the boy and they
left the office talking and laughing.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p>The first public appearance of the boys, aside
from auxiliary meetings, annual Christmas dinners,
attending theatres, entertainments, base-ball
games, picnics, etc., and where the boys made a
favorable impression upon the public, was the
Sunday afternoon meetings held in suitable halls,
during the winter season. These were carried on
successfully and profitably for several years, until
the available halls were too small to accommodate
the increasing membership.</p>

<p>The idea of Sunday afternoon meetings suggested
itself from what the boys said.</p>

<p>“If we had meetings of our own we would not
attend Sunday afternoon theatres.” Three boys,
newsboys, were seen coming out of the back door
of a saloon on Sunday afternoon, and to the question
asked by the president, why they spent their
time in the saloon, they replied they had no other
place to go to get warm.</p>

<p>“Why not go home?”</p>

<p>“We are not wanted at home.”</p>

<p>At the Sunday afternoon meetings the entertainments
were given by the different Sunday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
schools of the city, and occasionally by some society,
all kindly volunteering their valuable services.
Splendid music, interesting talkers, little
girls and boys in recitations or songs who always
made a hit among the newsies. In time the newsboys
became so interested in the work that many
of them concluded that they could “do a stunt or
two,” and the program was divided in two parts.
First, the Sunday-school or society, followed by
the newsboys who introduced their best speakers,
singers, etc.</p>

<p>“These Sunday afternoon gatherings,” to
copy from an editorial in one of the daily newspapers,
“have improved the tastes, aroused the
better natures, stimulated the ambitions, revealed
new and nobler ideals and altogether, have opened
a new world of more sober and serious plans for
future success of the bright little business men.”</p>

<p>One of the most trying incidents that ever
came to the attention of the president was at one
of the Sunday afternoon meetings held in a theatre,
when was brought to the rear of the stage
two newsboys so drunk that a policeman had to
hold them from falling.</p>

<p>They had a bottle of whiskey between them.
In broken sentences they told where a keeper had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
sold them the liquor, Sunday morning, and how
the men in the saloon dared them to drink all the
whiskey in the bottle. It wasn’t necessary to
drink all, a few swallows made them dizzy. “We
got funny and noisy, an’ the man pitched us out.”
They staggered towards the opera house to attend
the newsboys’ meeting, when a policeman
assisted them in the house. Immediately upon
their entrance their friends hustled them out of
sight behind the stage. The president at once
called the association officers and turned the two
boys over to them. Quickly the officers removed
their badges. It was difficult to restrain some of
them from “giving the boys a thorough thrashing.”
Through the influence of the boy, Jimmy,
the sympathy of the newsboys’ turned quickly to
the two boys and a determination for revenge on
the saloon keeper followed. The newsboy officers
took the two little fellows to their homes. In a
few days they reported to the president that the
boys received such a severe punishment from
their parents that they would be laid up for a
month. The saloonman was visited by two of
the oldest experienced officers. They were received
with kindness, and after talking over the
matter for some time it was mutually agreed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the boys were to notify all members that they
must keep out of the saloon, as the proprieter
promised not to sell liquor of any kind to newsboys
and to refuse to sell liquor to any of the
fathers of the newsboys&mdash;“when he thought they
had enough.”</p>

<p>For a month the boys watched that saloon,
and if a newsboy entered, his badge was taken
from him. The saloonman took greater interest
than the boys, for he absolutely refused to sell
liquor to any one whom he thought had “all he
could carry.”</p>

<p>Today this saloonman is respected by the
newsboys and many good deeds are credited to
him.</p>

<p>“He is simply trying to lift up a man instead
of pulling him down,” said an officer.</p>

<p>The good that has been accomplished from the
Sunday afternoon meetings, commonly called
“The Popular Sunday School,” cannot be estimated.
Thousands of people attend these meetings.
They are pleased because the newsboys do
the entertaining. There isn’t a great deal of
preaching, but there is enough. “The object is
not to give so much of that sort of thing,” says
an editorial in one of the great dailies, “but what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
preaching they get is wholesome. The boys get
a chance to laugh and clap their hands. They
are permitted to be boys on Sunday just as on
week days. There is good music, too. It is apt
to be a patriotic air, or a popular song. A sweet
little girl sang ‘The Good Old Summer Time,’
and the newsies joined in the chorus. It wasn’t
classical, but it was good. Instead of shooting
over people’s heads the musicians aim at their
hearts. The preaching isn’t a tiresome string
of ‘does’ and ‘don’ts,’ ‘musts’ and ‘mustn’ts’. It
is mostly plain talks from plain people who know
they are talking to boys whose veins are bulging
with rich, red human blood. But the boys themselves
furnish most of the program. Boys who
sell papers, who shine shoes, on the streets, get
up before big audiences, make speeches, sing
songs, ‘recite pieces’ and do other interesting and
instructive stunts. And hundreds of these little
newsboys sit in the auditorium, conduct themselves
like gentlemen and thoroughly enjoy the
entertainment. An interesting fact about this
association, is that its membership comprises the
rich as well as the poor. If a rich man’s son carries
a route he is in the same boat with the poorest
lad that peddles papers on the street. There are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
boys who have rich fathers, boys who have poor
fathers, boys who have industrious fathers, boys
who have drunken fathers, and boys who have
no fathers at all. There are Protestant boys, Catholic
boys, Hebrew boys, white boys, black boys&mdash;and
all are full-fledged, honored members of the
same newsboy family, which is run on the principle
of equal rights for all and special privileges
for none. Rich boys are not debarred. There is
a desire to save them from wealth’s temptations
and make good citizens of them in spite of their
handicap. The poor boys who sell papers to help
keep the family from starvation are generous and
are willing to let the rich in on the ground floor.
So it is a pretty broad and big Sunday-school.
And a good one. Every boy who belongs to it
is better for his membership. He is taught to
travel on his own merits and not lean on his papa.
He is taught that he must paddle his own canoe;
and that he will be judged by what HE does, not
by his father’s success.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p>So great became the interest in the success of
the Boyville Newsboys’ Association that many
additions were made to add to its prosperity,
through which the association became favorably
known throughout the United States.</p>

<p>A newsboys’ band of thirty-eight pieces was
organized, the sellers being in the majority. The
expense of the band was borne entirely by one of
the enterprising dailies. The musical talent, discovered
by an efficient leader, in the newsboys,
was remarkable. In less than a year they were
able to play some of the most difficult pieces, and
the general deportment of the boys surprised all
who saw them.</p>

<p>The organization of the South-end Cadets
was an event which proved to be one of the most
successful additions to the association. Their
fine personal appearance, their remarkable drilling,
their good behavior at all times and on all
occasions, with the band, made Boyville extensively
and favorably known as the home of the
best newsboys in the world.</p>

<p>Nothing in the history of the work among
the newsboys was as important as the interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
taken by the various churches, regardless of sect,
through their ministers, in holding special Sunday
evening meetings for the members of the
association. All through the city the auxiliaries
were invited, and particular pains taken in the
preparation of a program suitable to all. When
the boys were first invited, the expression was
frequently heard: “Gee wiz, we gets front rows.”
The illustration shows the boys marching to one
of these evening entertainments.</p>

<p>The value of these meetings cannot be estimated.
The good attendance, the close attention,
the good behavior of the boys made them many
friends, and people began to look more kindly
upon the newsboy.</p>

<p>With these improvements in the street-boy
and the success of the association naturally, the
president received many letters from men and
women all over the land seeking information
about the detail work of the association.</p>

<p>With the view that this work may eventually
be extended throughout the country, the president
conceived the idea that a convention of newsboys
and their friends might be held and a National
association organized through which much
good could be accomplished. He therefore opened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
correspondence with the managers of the World’s
Fair, St. Louis, Mo., with a view of getting their
consent and approval to set apart a day to be
known as Newsboys’ Day. This met with prompt
reply and a most hearty endorsement of the officials,
and newspaper representatives generally
throughout the United States, and resulted in
selecting Tuesday, August 16, 1904, as Newsboys’
Day.</p>

<p>That the convention might prove a success,
particularly among men who are familiar with
work among newsboys, the aid of the circulating
managers of the newspapers was asked. At the
annual convention of the National Association
of Managers of Newspaper Circulation, held at
the World’s Fair June 12, 1904, the president of
“Boyville” appeared and explained the methods
adopted in this association. He satisfied them
that, not only did the association accomplish much
good, through its efforts to influence boy’s work,
but it also proved to be a great aid to the newspapers
in increasing circulation. He therefore
asked for endorsement and support of the members
of this organization in forming a National
Newsboys’ Association.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>In recognition of this a resolution was unanimously
passed endorsing the movement; and a
committee was appointed to co-operate with the
trustees of the Boyville association with the view
of not only making Newsboys’ Day a success but
in organizing a National Newsboys’ Association.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p>On the afternoon, of Tuesday, August 16,
1904, in the magnificent Festival Hall, at the
World’s Fair, where were present hundreds of
newsboys, representing nearly every State in the
Union; and newspaper representatives from the
leading papers of the country, there was organized
The National Newsboys’ Association; officers
were elected and instructions were given
them to perfect the organization and adopt the
plan so successfully carried on by the Boyville
Newsboys’ Association, and having for its object
the extension of the work in every town and city
in the land that there may be established fraternal
relations among newsboys everywhere in
making them an important part in the business
world, honored and treated with respect by all
good citizens.</p>

<p>While the details of the organization were
being worked out, the officers were instructed, by
the trustees, to issue membership cards and
badges and to organize auxiliaries in cities and
towns wherever desired.</p>

<p>A year has passed since the organization of
the National Newsboys’ Association, and the officers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
have established auxiliaries in many cities
and towns in the United States with inquiries
from foreign cities.</p>

<p>In the discussion regarding the formation of
the constitution etc., it was agreed that an organized
association of newsboys with an enrollment
of twenty-five boys would be received into
the National Association as an auxiliary, and, in
towns where there were a less number than
twenty-five newsboys, each boy could become
members under the trustees of the National Association.</p>

<p>No recognition of the work accomplished by
the National and Boyville Associations was so
important and no greater good can be accomplished
than the official approval and endorsement
by the officers of the greatest railroads in
America.</p>

<p>It is an undisputed fact, railroad detectives
as authority, that a majority of the young men arrested
for stealing merchandise from freight cars
were once boys who sold or waited for newspapers
at the stations of our railroads.</p>

<p>The officers of the Boyville Association have
on file congratulatory letters from prominent
railroad detectives heartily approving of the work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
accomplished in trying to teach the boys who sell
or wait for papers at the stations, honesty. One
detective wrote: “You are saving the railroads
thousands of dollars worth of property and a million
dollars worth of trouble.”</p>

<p>The railroads who have approved of the work
have permitted the officers of the National Association
to issue circular letters to their agents instructing
them to allow no newsboy to sell or
wait for newspapers at the stations unless he is a
member of the association and wears, while on
duty, the official badge. This simply means that
newsboys to sell or wait for papers at railroad
stations must not swear, steal, lie, smoke cigarettes
or gamble. The trustees, feeling that the
good work accomplished among the newsboys
would be still further advanced by bringing the
National Association to public notice, decided
that the expense of sending the newsboys’ band
and cadets to Washington, to take part in the inaugural
parade of President Theodore Roosevelt
on March 4, 1905, would be justified.</p>

<p>Correspondence with the inaugural committee
proved one of the pleasant experiences, for
the recognition by the chief marshall and other
officials of the civic grand division was quickly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
and heartily given. The work of completing the
detail arrangements, necessarily irksome, was so
cordially conducted that the trustees felt more
than ever justified in sending the newsboys’ band
and cadets, and the vice-presidents of the various
auxiliaries, in order that Boyville could be officially
represented.</p>

<p>“Sixty-five newsboys let loose in the city of
Washington during the inaugural ceremonies
would cause the men in charge more trouble and
unhappiness, and disgrace to the city represented
than the honor gained,” was the public declaration
of men who were not familiar with what
could be done by newsboys.</p>

<p>Satisfactory arrangements were made in all
details.</p>

<p>To show the activity and self-responsibility
of a newsboy, while the boys were en route they
stopped at Cleveland. Two hours were given
them to go where they pleased. In less than an
hour the sellers said:</p>

<p>“We have done the town, been all through the
public buildings and we’re ready to go. We were
treated like reporters.”</p>

<p>In Washington thirty minutes after their
arrival at headquarters, the president called a
dozen boys to him and tried to tell them how to
find their hotel(?) from a given point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>“Aw, what you trying to give us. We ain’t
asleep. We’ve been round the square, and say,
president, we found a first-class eating place.
It’s out o’ sight.”</p>

<p>Two hours after the boys were settled, a
majority of them had been through and around
nearly all of the public buildings, and were ready
“to do the White House.” When requested to
report at a stated hour and place, every boy was
there on time and to the minute.</p>

<p>One of the greatest lessons the president
learned from the trip, from these newsboys, was
the perfect control they have of themselves.</p>

<p>They were always happy. Always contented
and satisfied with conditions. Never complaining
or borrowing trouble showing that worry is
a thing unknown to newsboys. The loss of a hat,
of a piece of baggage, an order changing contemplated
plans, all were received with the same wonderful
patience and good cheer, which seem part
of the nature of a newsboy. The boy without a
cent in his pocket was happier than the boy whose
parents supplied him with more money than he
needed. Wherever these boys appeared on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
streets of Washington they were little gentlemen,
an honor to the city who sent them, an honor
to themselves and, an honor to the great
country they represent. On the train en route
Governor Myron T. Herrick, in his address to the
boys said: “I consider it a very great honor to
the state of Ohio to send from its commonwealth
such a bright lot of boys, and boys who represent
our little street merchants, boys who are destined
to be the good men of the future.”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p>Newsboys are students. From the necessity
of knowing the special happenings of the day, as
soon as they receive their papers they quickly
read the head lines. First, they can be seen to
slowly spell each word, but in a very short time
they read without assistance. It is one of the advantages
to boys selling papers, it is an educator.
To be successful, they must become familiar with
the news of the day and be able to cry it to induce
men to purchase.</p>

<p>After the inaugural parade, when most people
were tired, the newsboys, at their headquarters,
“chipped in” and raised enough money to
send one of the boys “down town to purchase a
copy of every paper sold in the city.” The boy returned
with New York, Philadelphia and Washington
dailies and a dozen sellers were seated on
the cots, each earnestly reading, and commenting
on leading articles. One little seller said:</p>

<p>“Say, look here, fellers, Teddy has started to
work, he made an appointment. I guess he means
business.”</p>

<p>Is there another organization whose members,
when attending a convention, are so interested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
in the news of the day as to send one of
their number&mdash;“down the avenue to purchase a
copy of each of the dailies the town takes?”</p>

<p>From the highest officers in the land; from
the committee in charge of the various divisions;
from the foreign as well as the Washington newspapers,
praise and compliments were given
these newsboys for the almost perfect marching,
in the parade.</p>

<p>They said:</p>

<p>“The newsboys’ band and cadets made the hit
of the day, in the parade, and made thousands of
friends throughout the United States * * *
President Roosevelt was immensely pleased with
the newsboys and could not say enough of the remarkable
appearance they made. The Newsboys’
Band and Cadets, sixty-five in all, which
led the third brigade of the civic grand division,
are the first newsboys in America to be recognized
in an inaugural parade. The band thirty-eight
pieces, is uniformed in red with black trimmings;
the cadets, twenty, with red and white
trimmings. The cadets march under the leadership
of Drum-Major Francis McGarry, the
youngest drum-major in the world, and a little
fellow who has to take a hitch-step every other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
step in order to keep up with the procession. The
general appearance and manly conduct of the
young gentlemen elicited many favorable comments.
They were an object lesson of a very remarkable
character, which is calculated to arouse
in them a higher degree of patriotism and love for
their country.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p>The reader will observe that when Boyville
was well organized no boys were admitted to
membership except those who sold newspapers
or shined shoes. But later, after many years of
work, incident after incident came to the president
of the wrong-doings of the carriers who occasionally
sold extras. Those boys came from the
best families and much was expected from them
by the sellers. But some of them proved to be
very bad boys. The following is one of a number
of incidents that induced the president to include
the carriers in the association.</p>

<p>A very kind lady, living in the heart of the
city, and who was a subscriber to one of the dailies,
reported to the president; “a boy who carried
my paper and whom I owed eighteen cents, has
skipped with a dollar. He did not have the change
and asked permission to cross the street to get it.
I saw him run down the street as fast as his little
legs would carry him. I knew he was running
away and would not return. It is not so much on
account of the money, that I call your attention
to this, as it is to correct the boy, and save him
from future wrong doing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>She was asked to describe the boy. As it was
dark this was difficult.</p>

<p>“But I did notice,” she said, “that he had on
a very bright pink necktie.”</p>

<p>This was the first instance she knew of the
boy being dishonest. He had always delivered
the paper promptly, never missing a day.</p>

<p>“But, a big new dollar was too much for him.”</p>

<p>Immediately upon the receipt of this information
the president called his best officer and repeated
the story.</p>

<p>“A pink necktie,” he said. “Let me see, there
is a pretty lively little fellow that comes down
town occasionally and poses on the corners. I
know him. He always wears that necktie.”</p>

<p>Inquiry among the sellers soon gave the officer
all the information necessary as to where the
boy lived. He was not a member of the association.
He was a carrier. He was supposed to be
good. A dozen boys knew the pink necktie
carrier.</p>

<p>Following is the official report of the officer
who went after the boy.</p>

<p>“I found he lived over a mile from the place
where he delivered the paper. It was a swell
part of the city. When I went there I asked for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the boy. He was in bed. I told his mother I
wanted to see him on some very particular personal
business. He was tucked up in a nice warm
bed, and I hated to disturb him. When I asked
him if he had received a dollar from a lady for
papers, he covered his head with the clothes. I
knew I was right. I told him to get out of bed,
and go with me to see the lady, return her money,
and beg her pardon. I had him dead to rights for
he didn’t want his mother to know what he had
done. I went down stairs and told his mother I
had some very important things we boys wanted
him to do. She hesitated a little and finally let
him go. He dressed, and when on the way I told
him he must get down on his knees and beg the
lady’s pardon; he cried and said, ‘I will go home
before I’ll do that.’ All right, I said, if you want
your mother to know what a little rascal you are,
how you steal money, we’ll go back, but if you
want to be a little man, and make things right,
with my help, well and good. When we reached
the house, we had to go up a stairway, and the
boy threw himself on the steps and said, ‘Oh, I
can’t do this,’ but I said you could steal all right,
so come on. Up the stairs we went, and I knocked
at the door. I thought that boy would faint.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
‘Oh, I can’t do it,’ he cried, when the door opened
and the lady stood before him. She understood
the situation. She lifted him to his feet. I pulled
him back, and said, ‘No, my lady, he must get
down on his knees, return you the dollar, and beg
your pardon.’ It was a tough job for that kid, but
he did it; and after it was all over he said, ‘My!
but I feel better, I’m glad this is over.’ On the
way he told me he had spent forty cents and had
but sixty cents left to pay the lady, so I gave him
the money to make the dollar, and he is to pay me
five cents a week until all is paid up. On the way
home he was the happiest lad I ever saw. The
lady said it was the slickest piece of detective
work she ever heard of, and wished to thank you
and the boys for starting the association.”</p>

<p>A few days after this little incident, the
boy was brought to the president, by the officer,
requesting that he become a member of Boyville.
His name was signed to an application and when
the officer asked him how he felt after returning
the dollar, he looked a little ashamed, but quickly
said: “You bet, I’ll never do any thing like that
again. It isn’t safe in this city, the kids find a
fellow out when they are bad. I’m glad we fixed
it up all right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>He gradually paid back the money the officer
advanced. Two years have passed since that
eventful night, and today the boy is one of the
most efficient officers in the Boyville association.</p>

<p>The following editorial is taken from one of
the city dailies relative to the pink necktie story.
It reads:</p>

<p>“The story explains how well the officer did
his work. There is a lesson for boys and men,
too, in this little story. It shows that policemen
and jails are not necessary when boys and men
know how to do right. No policeman, judge or
jury was needed to straighten out this difficulty.
Newsboy government did the work. It got the
woman her money, and taught the boy with the
pink necktie a lesson he will never forget. He
didn’t have to be arrested or go to jail. The
public will never know who he is. He will not
be further disgraced. Now, why do these boys,
officers of this association, do this? simply because
they are proud of the reputation of their
association. They have learned that the association’s
reputation is made up of the reputations
of its members. They have learned that one dishonest
act by one newsboy reflects on all newsboys
and on the organization. So they insist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
that all members must be honest and protect the
association’s good name. It isn’t fear of the policemen
or jails that makes these boys honest. It
is the fear of their own conscience and the opinion
of their comrades. They want to be able to
walk along the street with their heads up, and to
look every honest man squarely in the eye. They
know they are as good as the richest man in town
if they are honest. They are learning that it pays
to do right, and not because of what may happen
to them as a result of dishonesty. If men would
follow the same plan the world wouldn’t need its
thousands of jails, reformatories and penitentiaries.
If men would only feel that each one of them
is a member of the human society, association or
organization, and that wrong committed by one
is a reflection on all, it would save heartaches and
trouble in this world.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p>Do you believe a boy that is good at home,
one who is cared for and loved as we often
see an only child, could possibly do anything bad
on the streets, away from home influence?</p>

<p>A neatly dressed boy, a carrier, whose parents
“wanted him to learn the trade of the street, to
give him self-reliance and business tact, and all
that the street teaches without much effort,”
when through with his little route of carrying
papers insisted upon going, “to the heart of the
city and selling papers on special occasions, extras.”</p>

<p>Before Boyville was fully organized the president’s
attention was called to this little fellow&mdash;as
being “a perfect nuisance. He was impudent,
frequently used profane language and was one
of the worst boys on the street.” At that time the
association had but one (boy) officer. He was
told to watch this boy. See that he was corrected.
“And, above everything not to lose him because
he was bad.” Within a month the officer reported
“the boy’s parents were among the best in
the city, good Christian people, attending church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
every Sunday, and the boy a regular prize-winner
for perfect attendance at Sunday-school. When
this boy was away from home, out of sight of his
parents&mdash;he was a little terror.”</p>

<p>“Well, what did you do with him?” was asked
the officer.</p>

<p>“I takes his papers, an’ shows him as how to
sell ’em. How to say thank you when he sells to
a gemmen or a ladies. And how’s not to be the
whole thing when on the street working. He cut
out swearing de furst thing. He was easy doing,
all he wanted wus guidin.”</p>

<p>“What did he say to your work?”</p>

<p>“When I puts twenty cents in his hand, an’
says this is yourn, he gets wise, he gets next to
a good thing and is now working on de square.
He is de boss seller on de street an’ no boy kin
sell on de corners and swear, or steal. He fights
’em. He does.”</p>

<p>That same little boy, who was given a warning
by a fellow companion with a little authority,
today receives a salary of eight hundred dollars
a year in an important commercial position.</p>

<p>In every city of our land there are hundreds
of boys like this “good boy at home,” who on the
street surprises their most intimate friends by
their wickedness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>The newsboy cannot gain admission to many
of the boys clubs, debating clubs, athletic clubs,
and is often debarred from many of our greatest
christian associations, because he is a being
within himself, he stands alone in his class, a
creation of his own acts and deeds, and goes upon
the street at that age when environment molds
his future, and generally molds it bad.</p>

<p>A question is often asked, what would become
of a boy if he were left to himself, with no training,
no guidance, no education. A boy of the
street, who is dead to home influences, or worse,
who is driven out to make a living for himself by
heartless parents or guardians, or unfortunate
conditions of life, and there are hundreds of them
in every city, becomes a power in himself. For
evil, first. “For the heart of the sons of men is
fully set in them to do evil.” If left alone the
evil will get the upper hand. The street teaches
irregular habits and restlessness.</p>

<p>The following incident will show how diligent
were the boys, not officers, in watching their companions.</p>

<p>Two little boys, ages nine and twelve, saw a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
fellow member standing in an alley, behind a
pile of store boxes and enjoying a cigarette to
his great delight. He was afraid to appear on
the street as the boys were watching for such
cases. He was a boy about fifteen years of age,
rather stout and independent, but a staunch member
of the association. He might have used his
strength to great advantage in arguing with the
two boys who attacked him as soon as discovered.</p>

<p>“Say, Mike, youse knows it’s agin the rule
to smoke dem cig’rettes.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s all right. If I wants to smoke, I
smoke, see? No one sees me in the alley. I
don’t smoke when I sells me papers.”</p>

<p>“Aw! comes off, youse knows de rules. Cut
it out. Trow it away. Youse knows our president
don’t wants youse ter smoke ’em. Cut it
out. Trow it away.”</p>

<p>This persuasive talk or “bluff” as the smoker
declared, had but little effect until the two boys
began to take off their coats. When donned for
the prize ring, the boys walked to the violator,
presenting a bold front and again demanded that
the cigarette be thrown away, and promise made
that he would never smoke again.</p>

<p>“What youse goin’ to do?” he said, backing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
up closer to the building. “We will trow you
down, take your badge frum youse an’ take it to
the president.”</p>

<p>The big boy stood quiet for some moments, in
the mean time about thirty newsies had gathered
around him, each yelling&mdash;“trow it away.”</p>

<p>“I haint lookin’ fur no trouble,” he finally
said, and threw the cigarette in the alley.</p>

<p>“We’s only doin’ you a good turn,” said the
nine-year-old newsy.</p>

<p>“It’s all right. I was only tryin’ to see if you
would stop me. I’ll cut it all out. I will never
smoke again.”</p>

<p>That boy did not have to be watched. He was
good and kind to his little friends, and proved to
be one of the best boys on the street. Two years
later, when he graduated from the junior grade,
in one of the ward schools, he came to the president,
saying that his mother was poor and sickly
and he had to go to work. He was sent to a
wholesale house where was wanted a good honest
boy.</p>

<p>The first question asked Mike was:</p>

<p>“Do you smoke cigarettes?” The president
will never forget the manly, prompt reply. He
was given a good position, and that boy today is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
traveling for a firm in Cleveland, Ohio, at a big
salary. The increased interest in the detail work
taken by the boys themselves encouraged the
president to believe that he was still on the right
road to build these little street-boys up for good,
not only for themselves but for doing good
for others. Another case of interest in an unusual
way of “doin’ a good turn.” A bright-eyed,
red-faced boy, ten years old, came running
into the president’s office, one evening, almost
out of breath, and after clearing the way through
a long room, he stood before the officer, eyes
sparkling with interest. He had something important
to say. His elbows were bare, his pants
torn, his cap merely a piece of cloth, with a rim
strong enough to hold it in place. His name was
Bluster, receiving it from the boys on account of
his blustering manner of doing things.</p>

<p>“Say, pres.,” yelled Bluster. “I want authority
to lick a kid.”</p>

<p>That was a strange request. While the president
was thinking what to say he added.</p>

<p>“I must have permission fur de gang’s after
me. Dey’re on me track.” Not desiring the
gang to enter the office and create a scene, consent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
was given for Bluster to use force, if necessary
to defend himself. A smile of satisfaction
came over Bluster’s face. A smile that indicated
that he had taken advantage of the president, and
was now about to glory in it. After a moments
thought he said.</p>

<p>“Say, pres., I already licked him.”</p>

<p>“Who and what for?” was asked with considerable
surprise.</p>

<p>“Fur swearin.”</p>

<p>Before he could explain the details of the
case, in rushed eight or ten boys, all talking at
once. Bluster never smiled when the boys declared
he wasn’t an officer and had no business
to “take the law into his own hands.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” put in Bluster, “ain’t we
supposed to work fur each others good? Well,
an’ wasn’t I ’tendin’ to my own business on de
corner. I wus standin’ there crying all about
de big fire, when a man frum de other side of the
street calls fur me to come over. I starts an’ so
does Swipsey, I beats Swipsey, an’ sells de man a
paper, an’ what does Swipsey do? Does he go
about his business? No, he told the man to go to
hell and used other swear words an’ I saw our
association wus receiving a black eye. It’s no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
use to preach to Swipsey, de only way to bring
him to his thinking is to lick him. He knows as
well as youses that its agin de rules to swear. So
I punched him. I turned him an’ rolled him over
until he cried enuf, an’ promised he would not
swear again. Then de gang came after me an’
I runned to you.”</p>

<p>The boys still declared he had no right to punish
Swipsey without permission from the president.
Quick as flash Bluster said:</p>

<p>“Say, pres., didn’t I have permission?”</p>

<p>The president could do nothing but back Bluster
up. He had given him full authority. At
this juncture, Swipsey made his appearance. His
hair disheveled, face and hands dirty, and clothes
in a terrible condition. Swipsey listened to Bluster’s
story with a great deal of patience. He
looked guilty.</p>

<p>“All we want to know,” said the leader of the
gang, “is whether we can punish a boy for violating
the rules, even if we are not officers.” That
was a leading question, and experience had
taught the president that it was a very wise thing
to have any boy punish a member, and in his own
way. The only provision made was that no badge
must be taken away from a boy by a non-officer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Where a boy cannot be corrected by a fellow
member, he must submit the case to an officer.
This was agreed to and the boys were satisfied
with the method used by Bluster. The two boys
were made a little present, and they all left in
their usual happy mood.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p>The more experience the president had with
the street-boys, boys who spent most of their time
in selling papers or shining shoes, the greater
his desire to keep in close personal touch with
each boy. He had learned that it was not wise
to censure a bad boy, to punish a boy who had
violated any of the rules. That belonged entirely
to the officers.</p>

<p>Some of the best suggestions for gaining the
most good came from the boys, and boys whom
the general public would ignore, pay no attention
to. The boys were working out their own salvation.
Solving the boy problem themselves.</p>

<p>The strongest argument for self-government,
among boys, was solved by the boys, the sellers.
This was when they began to bring to the president
money and valuable articles they found on
the streets, and the sincere, earnest request, in
every case, “to please find the owner&mdash;it doesn’t
belong to me.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>It was through the honesty of one of the hustling
sellers that this new work was started, which
became part of the great work and was carried
on so successfully, and to such an extent that
hundreds of valuable articles, from fifty cents in
pennies to a diamond necklace, were found and
returned to the owners. The following incident
was the starting point.</p>

<p>A stranger gave a little seller, what he supposed
was a new bright penny, for an evening
paper, and passed on. The boy renewed his work,
and a few moments later another gentleman purchased
a paper, giving the boy a dime. In counting
out nine cents, as change, the seller handed
the man the new penny he had just received from
a stranger. The customer said:</p>

<p>“My dear son, this is not a penny; it is a five
dollar goldpiece.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know it, sir”, replied the boy. “If
you will please to hold my papers I will run after
the man and try to find him&mdash;this isn’t mine.”</p>

<p>Around the corner the lad went at full speed.
Up and down the street he looked but failed to
see his man. He returned very much disappointed.</p>

<p>“He’s gone,” he said, “here’s your change&mdash;nine
cents.”</p>

<p>During this little talk a dozen or more newsboys
gathered around the man and when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
learned what had happened several of the boys
said:</p>

<p>“Harry, what you goin’ to do with the mon.?”</p>

<p>“Our president will tell us what to do, come
on,” replied the little merchant.</p>

<p>Off the crowd started down the street, around
the corner and a noisier lot of boys never entered
the president’s office.</p>

<p>Each of the twenty boys present wanted to
explain what he knew about the transaction.</p>

<p>All the details of how the seller received the
money, and how hard he had tried to find the real
owner were gone over several times.</p>

<p>The president complimented not only the
boy who received the gold, but the boys who were
so deeply interested in trying to find the owner.
An appreciative present was given to the boy,
and it was understood that every effort possible
would be made to find the owner. When it was
first advertised a generous clothier, a lover of
newsboys, presented the boy with a suit of clothes.
After advertising thirty days and no owner claiming
the five dollars, it was given to the boy.
Nothing ever happened in the neighborhood
where the newsboy lived that created such an
excitement. The newsie posed as an honest boy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
and was complimented by men and women, as well
as being a hero among the boys and girls. Its
effect was far-reaching, and did good not only
to the boys, but it had a most desirable effect
upon the people.</p>

<p>More particularly from this incident than
any other did the newsboys “get next” and begin
bringing to the president everything they
found. Among the articles brought to him with
instructions to find the owners, were diamonds,
watches, money, in amounts ranging from fifty
cents to eighty dollars; rings, robes, hats, gloves,
valuable papers, badges of all kinds, handkerchiefs,
money-saving banks, hundreds of addressed
stamped letters, pictures, pocket-books of
all kinds, keys, etc.</p>

<p>Among the live things the boys brought to
the office was a dog. One afternoon, late in the
autumn, four newsies walked into the president’s
office, talking and laughing, as they always do,
and one of the boys, being “soaking wet,” led a
little woolly dog who seemed to enjoy the fun as
well as the boys.</p>

<p>“My! how did you get so wet?” asked the
president. “And what have we here?”</p>

<p>“A man trowed de dog into the river. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
tried to drown him. I jumped into de water
and saved him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, president,” said the hero, “I thought
it would please you to save the dog’s life.”</p>

<p>Of course it pleased the president, and the
boys agreed it was a very brave act. This little
incident had its effect upon the boy, and they always
looked upon him as a great fellow, and it
wasn’t long until they elected him to an important
office.</p>

<p>It is a noticeable fact that newsboys have a peculiarly
natural way of drawing, what they call,
tramp dogs to them. Many a newsboy has been
seen caring for a poor dog, who had either lost
its owner or was hurt.</p>

<p>Sympathy is aroused very quickly. Often a
poor, worthless dog has been taken into a seller’s
favorite lunch-room and given a square meal.
From a boy who jumped into fifteen feet of water
to save a little dog, something might be expected.
He was watched. At one of the regular meetings
of an auxiliary he showed the metal he was
made of by introducing the following preamble
and resolution, and spoke so strongly in its favor
that it was passed unanimously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq p1">“<span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, It has come to our notice that boys
throughout the city, and boys, too, from our swell families,
are killing the song birds in the little patches of
groves within the city limits, by the use of the Flobert
rifle; therefore be it</p>

<p class="pbq"><i>Resolved</i>, That the members of the Boyville Newsboys’
Association bitterly disapprove of this wanton
slaughter of our song birds, and we, therefore, pledge
ourselves to do everything in our power to stop boys,
whether members of this association or not, from killing,
in any manner, these birds.”</p>

<p class="p1">In his closing remarks he said: “If we expects
people to show us kindness we must also
do something what’s right. And what can we
do better’n protect the dumb animals. Let us
show, what we are trying to get, kindness, justice
and mercy.”</p>

<p>A short time after the adoption of the above
resolution one of the trustees attention was called
to a member, a boy eleven years of age, who was
very much worked up over the acts of some of
his associates, not members of the association.
The boys had made a trap and were trying to
catch the robins that made their summer homes
in the yards along the street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>The little boy always told his mother his
troubles and in this case went to her for advice.
She told him she would pray that God would tell
the birds not to go near the trap. He seemed
satisfied, but went away deeply buried in thought.</p>

<p>A few days later he was sitting on the fence,
at his home, when the trustee passed. Knowing
of the incident he asked the boy about the trap.</p>

<p>“Well, the trap was set all right,” he said,
“and my mother prayed hard, asking God to
strengthen the instinct of the birds so they would
keep out of danger&mdash;not go near the trap.”</p>

<p>“Did God answer your mother’s prayer?”
asked the gentleman.</p>

<p>“Sure thing He did,” the newsy quickly answered.</p>

<p>“Why were you so certain?”</p>

<p>“Because when it got dark I went to the barnyard
and busted the trap all to pieces. There wasn’t
enough wood left to make a tooth pick.”</p>

<p>The trustee slowly walked away saying to
himself:</p>

<p>“Action was needed with prayer.”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<p>The individual interest in the monthly auxiliary
meetings developed into schools of instructions.
The boys began to learn how to debate,
how to make a motion, to discuss any subject.</p>

<p>The vice-presidents of each auxiliary took personal
interest in the details of the work, and kept
the various committees busy.</p>

<p>The reports at each meeting showed how well
the boys had the affairs of the association under
control. In the meetings, the entertainment features
were very interesting, from the fact that
the boys themselves prepared the program. If
it was necessary to secure talent, the executive
committee required each boy, beginning with the
officers, and then taking the names as the boys
were registered in alphabetical order to show
what he could do. First a boy, a bashful newsie,
was required to “step forward and make a bow,”
and after several pretty rough introductions of
this nature, it was always found that the victim
began at once to prepare something for the next
meeting. First, he would commit a very short
piece, perhaps two lines, always selecting something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
of a comical nature. Then later, of his own
composition. After a few efforts he became master
of the platform, and was generally over anxious
to do something.</p>

<p>It was surprising the different talents unearthed
by this method. Musical turns, good,
sweet singers, short and long recitations, original
dialogues, and many “new stunts,” as termed
by the boys, when surprised at what someone
produced.</p>

<p>The trustees always took advantage of this
work, and did everything to encourage it. The
talent thus discovered, and trained, in the auxiliaries,
was used in the Sunday afternoon meetings
to great advantage and honor to the boys.</p>

<p>At one of the Sunday meetings a very serious
carrier asked the president: “How can a boy
avoid being bad if he don’t know what bad is?”</p>

<p>“How do you know bad money?” asked the
president.</p>

<p>“I don’t know bad money, I know good
money.”</p>

<p>A newsboy is never at a loss for a reply to
any question, and knows something about any
subject discussed in our daily papers. This boy
further surprised the president by saying: “Those
who are thoroughly skilled in navigation are as
well acquainted with the coasts of the ocean, with
the sands, the shallow places, and the rocks as the
secure depths in the safest channels, and good
boys must as well know the bad that they may
avoid it as the good that they may embrace it.”</p>

<p>This boy occupied a front row for many
months in all entertainments, and when a speaker
interested him he paid very close attention. One
time a very good minister was talking over the
heads of the boys, preaching a sermon they could
not understand. This little fellow, with his ever
serious look, cried out:</p>

<p>“Say, mister, can’t you cut some of that out?”</p>

<p>It had its effect, much to the embarrassment
of the good divine.</p>

<p>It is one of the most difficult things in the oratorical
world for any one to entertain newsboys.
A speaker must not talk over them. He must
become as a child and talk as a child, and he will
be surprised to see what a good effect it has upon
the boys. One time a very nervous boy, a seller
from the avenue, became quite noisy and restless
in the seat he generally occupied. The president
observing this asked him if he would like a seat
in the front row.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sure thing, I’ll ’tend every Sunday if you
give me this seat,” pointing to a chair next to
a post, where the president imagined he wanted
to rest his head.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t make any difference what boy occupies
this seat,” said the president to “Front
Row Art,” as he is called, “I want you to get the
seat. I don’t care what we are doing on the
platform.”</p>

<p>One Sunday when the house was crowded to
the doors, Art’s seat was occupied by a boy about
fourteen years of age, and much stronger than
Art. While the speaker, a minister, was praying,
the president saw Art at the door. He saw him
push his way through the crowd and when at the
platform, he took the boy, who occupied his chair,
by the back of his neck and gave him such a shove
along the seats that the young man was glad to
reach the other end of the row. Art sat down,
folded his arms, put his feet upon the platform,
and eyed the speaker as if he had been there all
the time.</p>

<p>Art was always ready with a smart answer
to any question put to the boys. Even if his attention
was directed to another part of the house,
his little fingers were snapping, indicating his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
readiness to answer. His replies, while not always
pertinent, gave the speaker a fair warning
not to be too familiar in asking questions.</p>

<p>Art had a companion who was known as
“Splinter,” on account of his being rather slim,
but no boy of his age, twelve years, ever had so
many new movements as Splinter. He was never
quiet, not so noisy, but continually annoying the
boy who sat next to him. To take a companion’s
hat and throw it across the room, while some
good minister was praying, was of frequent occurrence.
He would answer questions without
raising his hand, and would give the boy sitting
next to him a knock of some kind before he stood
up. With all this restlessness he was one of the
best-hearted boys among the sellers. There was
something in him that the president concluded
he could not afford to lose sight of&mdash;just what
that was did not develop enough to encourage.</p>

<p>At one of the Sunday meetings there was a
speaker who knew how to hold the boys when
asking questions. He had them perfectly quiet
and recognized no answer unless the boy raised
his hand.</p>

<p>He asked a question which required as an answer
a verse in the Bible. To the president’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
embarrassment, “Splinter’s” hand was high above
the others and he kept a continual snapping of
his fingers. He was determined to be recognized.
The president was in hopes the speaker would
pay no attention to him, fearing the reply would
spoil the effect of the speaker’s talk. However
“Splinter” managed to be heard.</p>

<p>“That tall boy may answer,” said the minister.</p>

<p>The sweat rolled down the president’s forehead
as he tried to get back into his chair.</p>

<p>“Splinter” arose, not a smile on his face. He
looked serious, and without a quiver in his voice
repeated, word for word, one of the longest verses
in the Bible, and which gave an appropriate
answer.</p>

<p>The speaker looked as surprised as the president,
and the compliment he gave the boy was appreciated
by all.</p>

<p>“Splinter’s” education, after that, was looked
after.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<p>An interesting case came to the president
showing how one family can disgrace an entire
neighborhood; can give a bad name to a whole
street. On one of the small narrow streets
within the two-mile circle, lived a family, man
woman and five boys. One of the boys, a young
man, served a term in the penitentiary for robbery.
The names of two of them appeared on the
police station blotter about three times a year for
drunkenness. It was on account of these boys that
the neighborhood gained such a bad reputation.
The other two boys, John and Tom, ages nine and
twelve, were newsboys. Boys who were driven
from home, by the parents, “to get something to
eat elsewhere.” They frequently slept in stairways,
old buildings, cellar-ways or any place
where they could find shelter from the storms, or
where they thought they would not be disturbed.
These two newsboys were doing more to ruin boys
on the street than the entire membership of the
association, and when they came into the president’s
office seeking admission, the president concluded
that if these boys could be saved, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
their bad acts turned into good, Boyville would
be a success. It wasn’t necessary to ask them if
they were eligible to membership, if they sold papers,
if they were newsboys. Every word, every
act told all that was required. With all the rags,
and dirt, and slang talk, these boys were up-to-date
in everything. All the leading topics of the
day were discussed by them. Every base-ball
player they knew by name, and it was discovered
that all newsies followed them when they wanted
to get into a ball-ground free, or into a circus.
They had their own way, and without money.
They feared nothing. They worked for themselves
only. The little sympathy they had for any
one was drowned in their eagerness to move on.
They gave no thought for the morrow. There was
no hesitancy by the officers in giving these boys
membership cards, and when they received them,
to the question, “Well, now boys, what does this
mean?” they answered:</p>

<p>“We mean to lick any one as doesn’t do right.”</p>

<p>The vice-president, a smart young man with
the courage of a lion, went to the boys’ home to
make an investigation of how they lived, and why
they were so bad when on the streets. Here is
what he discovered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>They lived in a small cottage and with a man
and woman who were not their parents. Their
own father had died leaving several valuable
pieces of property to his wife, who was again
married within a year, and to a man who soon
lost all the property, having spent the money for
liquor. The mother died, and her husband again
married in less than a month, and to a woman
who drank as much as he did. This was the home
of the two newsboys.</p>

<p>“They both went to bed, nearly every night,
with their clothes on,” said the officer, “and what
the boys had to eat wasn’t fit for a dog.”</p>

<p>The case was left entirely in the hands of the
young officers with instructions to report within
a month. In less than the appointed time a report
was made. The two newsboys were brought
into the president’s office, each having on a nice
suit of clothes, their faces and hands clean, and
their general appearance and deportment remarkably
improved.</p>

<p>“What did you do?” was asked the officer.</p>

<p>“We went to the house and demanded that the
boys receive care and attention for what they
were doing&mdash;they were bringing into the house
from fifty to sixty cents a day earned by selling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
papers. And instead of the drunken man and
woman spending this for whiskey, we made them
buy good things to eat. A retail clothier gave us
the suits of clothes, and the boys are simply good,
and are working their way on the streets.”</p>

<p>While the boys were working on this case the
president reported to the humane officer the condition
of things at this home, and in a very short
time the family was quite respectable and the boys
attending school. To the president, remarkable
as seemed the turning of two bad boys into good,
honest little sellers, the work of the two officers of
the association with the parents was even more
so.</p>

<p>Self-governing boys. Boys whom we think
can do nothing, and seldom trust, for fear of failing,
and yet they brought in line two of the worst
cases Boyville had experienced.</p>

<p>As the weeks passed the two boys became favorites
among their little friends.</p>

<p>One afternoon about six or eight months after
the two boys became members, one of them, the
younger, came running into the president’s office,
holding a roll of bills in his hand. Everybody had
to get out of the way. He was followed by the
“gang,” some twenty boys, all looking at the little
fellow with wonderment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>“See, here, pres., what I found,” he said, laying
fifteen dollars on the desk. “I found this at
the post-office.”</p>

<p>“And what do you want me to do with this?”
asked the president. “I wants you to find the
owner. That’s what.”</p>

<p>“Well, why didn’t you blow it in? My! what
a fortune you have.”</p>

<p>“Blow it in? Would that be honest? No, sir,
as soon as I found de dough I broughts it to you
to tell us what we must do wid it, see?”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said the president, “and
you are teaching us all a good lesson. How often
we say; ‘it is just like finding it.’ and even grown
people wish they could find money, and would they
turn it over to someone, and ask him to please
find the owner? Not that they would think they
were doing anything wrong by keeping what they
found; they simply never thought of trying to
find the owner. You have done a great thing,
and here is a bright, new dollar, for your honesty.
I will advertise this in the daily papers for thirty
days, and if I can’t find the owner, it shall all go to
you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>Proudly they walked out of the office, all trying
to get closer to the happy finder, the honest
boy.</p>

<p>The money was advertised, and in a few days
the rightful owner was found. He wanted to see
the newsboy. For his honesty he presented him
with five dollars, adding: “In six months I want
to see you in this hotel. In one year if you are
reported all right by the officers of the association
I want you to write me at this address.” And he
handed him his card, which gave Indianapolis,
Indiana, as his home. Six months passed. The
boy met him in the hotel. The officers reported
that he was one of the finest and best boys on the
street. A year passed, and one day he received
a letter requesting him to “take the next train for
Indianapolis, provided the president of Boyville
says you do not swear, steal, lie or smoke cigarettes.”</p>

<p>The president could truthfully vouch for all
these, and the boy was sent to his new home.
Seven years have passed, and that boy today is
foreman of one of the largest manufacturing institutions
in the state of Indiana.</p>

<p>What effect did the good work of these two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
boys have upon the family? It caused them to
stand on the street posing as relatives to two honest
boys.</p>

<p>Does it pay to take an interest in a bad boy?</p>

<p>A boy of eleven years of age made application
to become a member. He was approved by the
proper officers. A sealed note accompanied the
application. It read: “He is accused of giving
wrong change to customers, and runs away with
money.”</p>

<p>As soon as he received his membership card,
and badge, and left the president’s office two officers
were on his track. They watched him sell
papers. Three days passed when he “stumbled
against something.” A gentleman in the post-office
gave him twenty-five cents for a morning
paper. He had no change, but excused himself
to “step across the way to get it.” Instead of
going into the store the little boy started in a run
around the building and was lost from sight.
The gentleman made this remark to a friend: “I
might of expected it.” This was overheard by
two newsboys. One said: “Oh, no mister, your
money is not lost. We’ll have it for you in ten
minutes. Don’t you be uneasy. You stand right
where you are for a few minutes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>Out ran the boys, one going to the right, the
other to the left, and a third joined them who took
to the alley. In less than ten minutes the boy was
brought to bay, and appeared before the gentleman.</p>

<p>An apology was given, the money returned.</p>

<p>“Don’t you say anything to him,” said one of
the newsboys, “we won’t do a thing to him, oh,
no.” The man soon forgot the incident, and will
never know the severe punishment that boy had
to bear. They took him in the alley, bumped his
head against the wall of the building, rolled him
in the mud, took his badge from him and with a
parting word of advice left him. The badge was
turned over to the president with instructions to
return it to the boy at the expiration of fifteen
days. What for? The president did not know
and only learned the particulars a month later
from one of the officers. The boy called for his
badge, and it was given to him without a word.</p>

<p>The books show that this same boy, after leaving
the junior grade in school procured a good
position and the proprietor particularly called
attention to him for a peculiar trait. He said:
“The boy applied for work, office work. We gave
him a job. He asked particularly how many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
hours he must work. When he began and when
he stopped. This given, we were surprised to
see that he was at the office every morning two
hours before his time, and pegging away at a
typewriter. His wages have been increased
three times. He’ll be one of the firm before we’re
through with him.</p>

<p>“The only recommendation he had was that
he was a member of The Boyville Newsboys’ Association&mdash;and
this we took. In fact, it proved
a better recommendation than that offered by his
mother, who called to get part of his wages to
purchase whiskey.”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<p>It was just before Christmas; the streets and
stores were crowded with people purchasing presents.</p>

<p>An old lady was standing on the corner waiting
for a street car. In her hand she held a small
package, a Christmas present for someone. A
boy, about fourteen years of age, darted out from
a door-way, grabbed the package, hastened down
the street and dodged into an alley. A newsboy
who saw the act started after the thief, and as he
ran several other newsboys joined in the chase.
While they were gone another newsboy went to
the lady expressing regret at her loss, but assuring
her the boy who stole the package would be
caught.</p>

<p>With tears in her eyes the old lady told the
boy that the box contained a number of presents
for a little girl who was confined to the house
on account of being a cripple for life. That the
purchase was the result of many weeks’ hard
work, sewing for some of her neighbors, that she
might earn the money to get a present for the
little girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now, my lady,” said the newsboy, “don’t
you worry for a minute, one of our officers started
in a dead run after him and I know he will
catch him. We don’t allow anything like that to
happen. That boy don’t belong to the association.”</p>

<p>The lady was escorted to a drug store where
people wait for cars, and advised to remain there
until the newsboys returned. She did not have
to wait long, for, in a short time, the officer returned
with a dozen newsies all trying to push
the “grafter” ahead of them. When in front of
the lady, he was made to hand her the package,
and get down upon his knees and ask her forgiveness.
The old lady was placed upon a street-car,
and the officers took charge of the boy. They
brought him to the president’s office.</p>

<p>“Mr. President,” said a member of the executive
committee, “we have here a new boy. He
was pretending to sell papers on the streets, but
he proved to be a ‘grafter,’ for we caught him
stealing a package from an old lady who worked
all summer to save money to buy a Christmas
present for a little girl who is a cripple. We run
him down.” The boy hung his head. He was
under no obligations to any of the boys, and could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
have been independant over his capture but when
he was told the package belonged to a little cripple,
it had a strange effect upon him. He lost
sight of everything but the wrong done to the
little girl.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know it belonged to a cripple or I
wouldn’t have taken it. You see, we at home don’t
think nothing of taking things as we can get, we
believe in helping ourselves to anything we wants
when no body is looking. I am sorry I took the
present.”</p>

<p>The boy lived in a bad neighborhood. His
father was dead, his mother had no influence over
him, he roamed the streets at will, and spent the
majority of his nights sleeping in freight-cars.
He was just the kind of a boy who grows up
along the docks of our lake cities, and takes advantage
of every opportunity to steal anything
he can use or care for without being detected,
from freight depots or cars. This is the class of
young men the association has been aiming to
reach for a long time. The selling of papers being
only a subterfuge for stealing. He was fifteen
years old and admitted having done many
bad things.</p>

<p>“It is boys like you,” said the president, “who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
disgrace any association, and while no one seems
to look after you, or want you, we will take you
into the association and the officers will have you
under their charge; what do you say to that?”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess you have me down pretty fine,
and if I wants to ever get a job I must start my
life over again.”</p>

<p>“The boys will forget this little package act,
and blot out all your bad deeds, if you will begin
a new life, and I will guarantee that in six
months, by the time warm weather comes, we
will get you a nice position.”</p>

<p>“If I would have known that package belonged
to a little girl do you suppose I would have
swiped it?” he added.</p>

<p>“It isn’t that alone we object to. Every time
you steal something someone suffers, and the only
way to avoid injuring any one is not to steal at
all,” said the president.</p>

<p>“Aw! tell him to cut it out, cut it out, he kin
do it just the same as we do,” put in a little bootblack.</p>

<p>“Yes, but you don’t have to go out on the
street and takes what ever you kin carry home,
like I do,” he replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, if your mother makes you do that we
won’t do a thing to her,” said a seller, who
claimed to own four corners.</p>

<p>The conversation ended by the president giving
the new boy a membership card with instructions
that he must report in thirty days.</p>

<p>Soon after he left the office, three members
of the executive committee hastened to his home.
The mother was warned that “this sending your
boy out to steal must stop, and stop quick.” They
listened to no arguments, simply gave advice and
orders, what must be done, and left.</p>

<p>A month passes and the day named for the
new applicant to receive his badge, found him at
the president’s office, as is usual with boys, an
hour before office hours.</p>

<p>“Gee, but I have lots of good friends. Some
of the boys took me to see a show, some let me
sell papers on their corners, but I had to cut out
swearing.”</p>

<p>The numbered badge was given him.</p>

<p>A member of the executive committee who
had him in charge reported:</p>

<p>“He was hard to bring down to our way of
doin’ things. It was natural for him to steal as
to eat, and he wanted to give the wrong change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
two or three times. We licked him three times.
He was game. Give him his badge, he’s all
right.”</p>

<p>Six months later this boy was given a position
in a wholesale house. He began on the top
floor to work his way up in the business.</p>

<p>His eagerness to learn, his willingness to do
things not exactly as part of his duties caused
his employers to notice him and he was advanced,
in less than two years, to shipping clerk in one
of the departments.</p>

<p>Here was a boy whose home life was degrading.
His neighbors paying no attention to
him or his family, except to say: “That boy ought
to be turned over to the police.” The newsboys,
the boys we often look upon as being bad and
useless, changed the life of this young man.</p>

<p>He is now slowly becoming one of the reliable
business men of the future.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<p>The president was about to board a street-car
for home one evening, when a dozen newsboys
came running towards him, calling him to
“come here.”</p>

<p>“Bundle found fifty-six dollars,” was heard
from a bunch of sellers. The president, of course
had to return to his office.</p>

<p>Bundle was a little round, red-faced boy, who
always wore a large scarf around his neck, and
in most any kind of weather. The sellers were
not surprised at any of their number finding
money but, said a bootblack:</p>

<p>“What’s going to happen when slow-pokey
Bundle finds something?” But he did, and at
the enterance of one of the largest buildings in
the city.</p>

<p>“There it was,” said Bundle, “all wide open
before my eyes, I stumbled over it and the money
scattered. Didn’t it Sam?”</p>

<p>There was nothing in the roll to indicate
its owner. Some one accustomed to carrying
money in his vest pocket had lost it. As soon as
Bundle picked it up, he called to the boys across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
the street and on the corners. A dozen boys answered
him, and they all marched towards the
president’s office. Each boy had something to say.</p>

<p>“Say, pres., we come near losing you, didn’t
we?” said Bundle, “but if you did go home I
would have stayed up all night holding the dough
until you come to your office.”</p>

<p>Bundle was rewarded, his companions were
as delighted as he was. A happier lot of boys
never walked the streets than these sellers.</p>

<p>The next morning, Bundle, with five other
boys came into the office, their faces were long;
Bundle looked sad.</p>

<p>“Bundle got a licking,” said one of the boys
looking sympathetically at Bundle. The president
looked surprised.</p>

<p>“Got a licking, and what for?”</p>

<p>“His mother licked him because he brought
the money to you. She said it belonged to her and
she could spend it as she liked.”</p>

<p>It was a fact that Bundle was severely punished.</p>

<p>“All the boys on the street saw me get a whipping,”
said Bundle, “and I don’t like it.”</p>

<p>The boys were assured that all would come
out right in the end. “You just wait until we
hear from the advertisement we put in the papers,”
said the president.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys were soon playing upon the street.</p>

<p>A prominent clothier saw the notice of the boy
finding the money and his desire to seek the
owner. He wrote the president: “If you will
send that honest boy to me I will present him
with the best suit of clothes in my store.”</p>

<p>The mother accompanied Bundle to the store
and not only did he receive a new suit of clothes
but an overcoat as well.</p>

<p>Within forty-eight hours after the find was
advertised the rightful owner appeared, received
the money, and presented the boy with a five
dollar bill and a good watch.</p>

<p>“Keep this watch to remind you that if you
will follow up your honest beginning, you will
not only be a rich man, but a good one.”</p>

<p>The object of relating this incident is the
sequel.</p>

<p>The big head-line compliments in the newspapers;
the many little presents and congratulations
Bundle received had a surprising effect
upon his mother. She was proud of being the
boy’s mother. Her sons and daughters posed on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the corners and pointed with pride to their
brother.</p>

<p>Not only did this act have a good effect on
the boy and the family, but upon the entire street,
as the remark is often heard, “this is the street
that has the honest newsboy.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<p>There are many interesting cases coming to
the attention of persons interested in newsboys,
and they all have a tendency to awaken sympathy.</p>

<p>Two little boys, ages nine and ten, were
brought to the president one morning by an officer
of the association. They were accused of
fighting, “almost to a finish.”</p>

<p>Between sobs and tears they both tried to
tell why they were fighting. While telling their
story, a boy about fourteen years of age entered
the office. He was also crying, but more seriously.
The president turned to him and sympathetically
asked, “what is the matter?” With
his hands rubbing his eyes he answered: “One
of the newsies run out of the alley and throwed
my papers into the gutter and they’re all spoiled.”</p>

<p>“Where did the boy go?”</p>

<p>“He runned away and left me alone.”</p>

<p>“How many papers had you?”</p>

<p>“I had four.”</p>

<p>The two boys that were crying, forgot
their troubles and became interested in the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
boy. Calling the two boys, the president asked
them if they would run out and try to find the bad
boy who threw the papers in the street. Of course
they were delighted to go. Taking the crying
fourteen-year-old newsboy by the hand, the little
fellows left the office.</p>

<p>After waiting an hour, and no signs of the
boys returning, the president went upon the street
and to his surprise saw the two little boys, who
were to hunt down the villain, playing together.</p>

<p>“Well, what was done with the boy who ruined
Joe’s stock of papers; did you find them?”</p>

<p>“You see, we went to the alley, we looked
ebery place fur the kid as what threw de papers
into de gutter, but he had skipped. So me an’
Skinny talked it over quickly an’ we just gave Joe
eight cents an’ told him to go home, to fade away,
to forget it. As de case wus settled we thought
it no use ter bother you wid dis trouble, an’ we
resumed our bizness.”</p>

<p>Certainly a new way of settling troubles.</p>

<p>There is a small boy who has the reputation
of being a little boss in the territory in which he
sells, owing to his desire to settle all disputes in
his own way. He goes upon the idea that it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
absolutely necessary to resort to pretty severe
punishment to gain a point.</p>

<p>One evening a boy about fifteen years of age
came into the office, crying as a boy only can; the
tears found considerable trouble in working
their way down his cheeks, making his face look
as if furrows were established for a time at least.
On the left side of his forehead were several clear
spots, round in shape, which he pointed to with
considerable feeling. The president’s sympathy
was aroused, and to the question, how he was
hurt, he replied:</p>

<p>“Firetop&mdash;licked&mdash;me. He&mdash;hit&mdash;me&mdash;with&mdash;his&mdash;fist.”</p>

<p>Firetop was not over nine years of age, and
the president knew of his fighting qualities, but
somehow no one ever presented any charges
worthy of investigation. His name, the boys
said, “came to him on account of his red hair.”
His reputation for honesty was never questioned.
He was simply a fighter. He was one of the most
successful sellers on the street. Because he was
a “pusher, he went every place, and asked every
person he met to buy a paper.” While the boy
was telling his story, three other members<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
dropped into the office. They stood for sometime
looking at the poor boy.</p>

<p>“Do you boys know Firetop?” asked the president.</p>

<p>“Certainly, we all know him.”</p>

<p>“Well, you go out and try to find him and tell
him I want him to come here immediately.”</p>

<p>Out the boys went and when on the sidewalk
started in different directions to find Firetop.
Ten minutes passed when Firetop came running
into the office. The boys had found him but he
was too fleet of foot for them.</p>

<p>“Pres., they tell me you wants me, what fur?”</p>

<p>“Look at that boy’s face,” said the president,
pointing to the injured lad who began to cry in
earnest.</p>

<p>“I see it. I did it. But say, kid” turning to
the boy, “what did I do it fur. Look up at me;
say, what did I do it fur?”</p>

<p>“For nothin’,” came a faint reply.</p>

<p>“Come off, I hain’t going ’round doin’ things
fur nothin’. Answer me, you kin talk, what did
I do it fur?”</p>

<p>No reply.</p>

<p>“Didn’t I punch you fur swearing at a lady?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>It was some moments before the boy answered,
and he drawled out, “yes.”</p>

<p>Firetop then told the story. The boy was
selling papers on the street, he asked a lady to
buy a paper, and because she refused he swore
at her, using language seldom seen in print.</p>

<p>“I heard it, an’ I told him it was against the
rules, an’ if he didn’t cut it out I would punk him.
What did he do but swore at me. He violated
the rules before my face. I punked, gently at
first, an’ then I punked him again. He ran into
the alley, I followed him, an’ de boys come from
the street, I told them he was my game, an’ I
punked him again. I told all the boys I would
punk de gang ef they came to help him. Say,
pres., wasn’t I right in punking him?” The boy
acknowledged he swore and Firetop kept at him
until he promised he would never do it again.
This was accomplished with very little trouble.
The boy’s face was washed and as there was no
traces of a wound the matter was amicably settled.
The boys left the office, good friends.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<p>This incident recalls another case of
swearing, and the peculiar method adopted
to correct a boy, as well as to influence a
family to train their son in the right path.
One reason why so many boys swear is because
they constantly hear men swear on the
streets. At Sunday-school the boy learns that
he is violating one of the commandments. But
men pay no attention to it, then why should boys?
Boys are imitative. They want to do what men
do. It is seldom that we hear of a mother approving
of her boy swearing and encouraging
him in this, certainly vulgar habit. This method
used by the president in curing a boy of swearing,
may not meet the approval of many of our Sunday-school
teachers, and it is given with some
reluctance. It is given, however, to show what
can be done in extreme cases.</p>

<p>“Are you the president of the Newsboys’ association?”
asked a boy with a very pretty face.</p>

<p>“Yes, and what can I do for you?”</p>

<p>“I want to join the association.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">“HE SWEARED AT A LADY AND I PUNKED HIM.”</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>The usual questions were asked and answered.
He proved to be a carrier and had
twenty-eight customers. A membership card was
given the boy with instructions to call in thirty
days and get the badge.</p>

<p>The boy left the office perfectly happy. In
about a week he returned, walked to the desk and
laid his membership card down, saying: “My
mother says I can swear all I want to, and you
have nothing to do with it. You must not tell
me to stop swearing.”</p>

<p>The president turned around, looked at the
boy for a moment, discovered he was unusually
bright, and back behind his black eyes he showed
the right kind of spirit indicating that if he made
up his mind to do a thing he would do it.</p>

<p>“So your mother wants you to swear. Well,
well, and she don’t want you to belong to any
association unless we all swear. Well, you shall
not be made unhappy. If your mother wants you
to swear you shall have that pleasure. Does
she swear?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, we all swear to beat the band,” he
replied, and in a tone indicating that it was one
of the pleasures of his home life.</p>

<p>“And don’t any of you think it wrong to
swear?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, no, father says he can swear and it gives
force to his arguments. Mother says if I want
to swear I can do it.”</p>

<p>“This association compels no one to stop
swearing&mdash;the rule adopted by the boys simply
says we don’t believe in it. And the officers
wouldn’t for the world have you do anything to
displease your parents.</p>

<p>“How many swear words do you know?”</p>

<p>He thought for a moment counting on his fingers,
then said:</p>

<p>“I know seven.”</p>

<p>“Seven big swear words, well, well, and can
you name them to me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, all of them and I may know another.”</p>

<p>“All right. Try it. One, two, three, four,
five, six; my! that’s an awful bad one, and&mdash;and&mdash;seven.
There they are.”</p>

<p>In repeating the words, his manner showed
he was familiar with their use. Not a blush rose
to his cheeks.</p>

<p>“Do you want to be a member of this association?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, all my friends are members and
they want me to join.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>“I will pin your card before me, on the desk.
See?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I see it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I will let it remain there until you call
for it, either to tell me to tear it up or you take it.
Now, here is what I want you to do. And this
not unless you want to. You go home, and every
time your mother wants you to do something use
one of those seven swear words, and say it loud
enough so she can hear it. Keep this up until she
tells you to stop that swearing.”</p>

<p>“I will do it, but suppose she licks me, then
what?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that would hardly be in keeping with
her teachings, she wants you to swear, doesn’t
she?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing, she never licks me for swearing.”</p>

<p>“Do you want to stop it and become a member
of the association? Well, you try this plan,
and if you can, throw the entire lot at her, the
seven words, all at once.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll try it. It looks easy.”</p>

<p>The boy left the office with a hearty “goodby.”</p>

<p>The following Saturday he returned. He
stood smiling at the desk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>“You can give me the membership card,” he
said laughing.</p>

<p>Recognizing him the president shook him by
the hand.</p>

<p>“Well, I have been wondering what luck you
had in swearing.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I had luck. Only got licked seven
times.”</p>

<p>“Got licked, and by whom?”</p>

<p>“Well, you would think the whole house fell
on top of me. Father said, send that boy down to
you at once, but mother licked me until I saw
stars. I’ll never swear again in our home. She
stopped it. She said she never heard such terrible
swearing and when I said I learned it of her, I
got the seventh licking. Gee, but I was sore for
a week. Mother told me the first thing this morning
to come after that card.”</p>

<p>“What did you do when you first went home?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I threw those seven swear words right
at her, and, from the very beginning. She looked
at me several times. I backed up, and when she
asked me a question, I let fly the worst word, then
I had to run.”</p>

<p>“What did your father say?”</p>

<p>“He only said, ‘didn’t I tell you that some day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
that boy would disgrace us, now it’s up to you to
straighten it out,’ and when they knew I told you
why the card was sent back, that changed everything.
I’ve been down here four times, father
made me go.”</p>

<p>His name was placed upon the books, a badge
was given him, “with a lucky number,” and he
left the office.</p>

<p>A month later the president met him at one
of the auxiliary meetings, and to the question,
“How about the seven swear words,” he said:</p>

<p>“We busted up swearing at our house. Everybody
had to stop it.”</p>

<p>No better worker on the street can be found
than this boy. His whole soul is in the work for
doing good among his associates.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<p>There is no subject that has received so much
attention and has worried so many good people
as the liquor question. Saloons and drinking
never cease to be problems for our well-meaning
temperance people. Why man created saloons,
no one undertakes to answer. The strongest man
is never too strong in a saloon, and the weak is
to be pitied. The saloon is an evil that has been
with us a long time and seems to be here to stay
in one form or another. While we cannot eradicate
the evil, especially by extreme methods,
can we not modify its influence? We have tried
the probation method, and failed. We have tried
the open saloon, the clubs, the no-treating, the
open reform saloon, the wet and dry division&mdash;but
the saloons are still with us, and this because of
the fact that the state, the city, property owners,
recognize the saloon legally, through the assessment
of heavy licenses and taxes, and good well-meaning
people ask and receive money from the
ever-willing giver, the saloonman, and use it for
charitable as well as church purposes. The world
today is heartless in its mad rush for money getting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
and the “graft” is in the minds of thousands
of well-meaning, but over-anxious to get-rich-quick
men; among them the saloonman. Let us
suggest to our saloonmen how they can stop a
great deal of misery in the world. We have in
mind a saloon that was “made good” by five newsboys.
“A real live saloon, where politicians congregated
to lay plans for work, and whose owner
had an eye to making money, and saw nothing
else, even to the ruining of boys and men.”</p>

<p>“Say, pres.,” said a newsboy from the saloon
district, and an officer of an auxiliary, “Jimmy
Smith is drunk and laying in the alley at the
saloon where politicians hold their meetin’s. The
bar-tender throwed him out.”</p>

<p>The books showed Jimmy Smith’s father was
a “ward politician,” a good fellow who was often
taken home drunk by his son, a newsboy. Jimmy
was eleven years old, very bright and intelligent
for his age. He learned to drink liquor through
his father and mother sending him to the saloon
for beer, and “dropping in the alley on the way
home and tasting the beer, until he began to
like it.”</p>

<p>To the question, “did you ever see Jimmy
drink in the saloon?” the boys answered that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
was a common thing; “but today when the bar-tender
took Jimmy’s nickel, and he was full, he
throwed him out. He said he didn’t want the
kid to disgrace his place.”</p>

<p>Three of the best officers were called, they
went to the alley, and took Jimmy home. Three
of the five boys who were assigned this case, belonged
to a gang and were familiar with all the
inside workings of a saloon, they were never slow
in showing their appreciation of a saloonman who
defended them, and who turned them down for
entering the saloon. The method adopted by the
boys was their work. They knew the proprietor
of the saloon, and knew him to be a very kind-hearted
man. No person ever asked him in vain
for a donation to any cause. His own boys were
model young men, stood high in school, and associated
with the best of church members.
Strange to say the two sons of the saloonman
were regular at Sunday-school. It is a fact that
when any society, church or other organization
desired aid, this saloonman was sought after by
a dozen persons. They knew he was easy. This
man in his home, on the street, in the lodge room
(and he belonged to many societies), in any public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
gathering, was recognized as an honest man;
but behind the bar he saw nothing but money.</p>

<p>He never thought he was doing a wrong by
taking the last cent from a drunken man; it was
business, and that was why he was there. When
reminded of it he simply replied that, “I might
as well have it as any one else, for someone will
get it.” Often he said: “He is bound to drink
and the best way is to let him drink up all his
money and that is an end of it.”</p>

<p>When the newsboys called upon him to plead
for their friend, Jimmy, they were received with,
“the utmost attention and kindness.” The following
is what the chairman reported:</p>

<p>“We said to the boss, we come to see you
about Jimmy Smith and his father. You see
Jimmy has been in bad company, the bad company
was at his home, his father an’ mother. He
learned the habit of drinking by tasting beer he
was sent after by his father, and he said when he
learned to drink that your clerk gave him a glass
of beer every time he came after it. So the other
day your bar-tender threw him out of the saloon.
He had gradually taught the boy to drink, and
when he began to get so that it annoyed him, he
didn’t want him. We come to see if you won’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
please stop giving Jimmy any more drink and tell
your man to throw him out of the saloon before
he drinks. We’ll stand for that, but we won’t
stand for his pitching him in the alley when he’s
got all of Jimmy’s money and is drunk. As to
his father, we don’t want you to sell him anything
when you see he has enough. Don’t take the last
cent he has when you know he is full already.
Send him home. His family needs every cent.
And don’t sell Jimmy any beer if he comes with
the bucket.”</p>

<p>The boys were treated with great kindness
by the owner of the saloon who promised to do
more than they asked of him. His bar-tenders
were instructed, under penalty of dismissal, not
to permit a newsboy in the saloon.</p>

<p>“I realize the wrong being done to the boys,”
he said to the president, “and it is through
thoughtlessness that we permit the boys to come
here at all. I’ll tell you what I’ll do. One of my
relatives has an interest in a commercial college.
I’ll buy this boy, Jimmy, a scholarship if he’ll go
to school.”</p>

<p>Jimmy was only too glad to accept.</p>

<p>Two years pass, and Jimmy is about to graduate
from the college. The manager said: “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
have four men after this boy. He has the right
kind of push in him to make a splendid business
man.”</p>

<p>Four years later Jimmy received a monthly
salary of $100, and during that time has assisted
in helping many a street boy.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<p>At one of the auxiliary meetings the vice-president
of the association, who was always
practical in his talks to the boys, gave a little advice
to the sellers.</p>

<p>It is worth remembering.</p>

<p>“Boys,” he said, “rain or shine be at your
post, at your corner. Never be out of papers, and
never be out of change. Many a good boy who
needs money loses a sale for want of having
change. Keep your eye peeled. If a man wants
a paper, you should see it, though he is a square
away. I know of one little boy, smaller than those
who were selling with him, who always saw a
customer a block away, and when the evening’s
work was over he generally had ten to twenty
cents to the clear more than others. Be polite
and always cheerful. Keep your face and hands
clean, and you will get many an extra nickel. If
you are polite and civil you will get a regular line
of customers who will always wait for you. Thank
everyone who buys a paper. Tip your hat to the
ladies and they will speak well of you when they
get home. Any little favor you can do for a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
or woman on the street (and not look as though
you expect something), will always bring you
business. The wind blew off the hat of a gentleman
one day, and a little seller saw it. Quick as
a flash he ran after it, took his own cap to wipe
the dirt off the gentleman’s hat, and handed it to
him. The gentleman said: ‘How many papers
you got?’ ‘Twenty-four, sir,’ said the boy. ‘Give
them all to me.’”</p>

<p>On the membership card it reads: “He does
not approve of swearing, etc.”</p>

<p>A probation member, a boy who received his
membership card, and had thirty days to wait for
his badge, brought an old member to the president,
one evening, with this plea.</p>

<p>“President, this boy swears like hell. I heard
him on the corner.”</p>

<p>“Aw, what you given us, you swear yourself.”
replied the accused.</p>

<p>“Yes that’s all right. Tell me something;
how would I know what swearing was if I didn’t
know something about it,” proudly answered
the new member.</p>

<p>“Well, you have no right to bring me here and
accuse me of doing what you yourself do. Read
your card, kid, read your card.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>Without showing any signs of worry, the little
fellow said.</p>

<p>“President what can you expect of a bationist.
When I get my badge things will be different.
I cuts swearing out then.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but you better wait instead of buttin in
before you are a live member,” said the carrier.</p>

<p>They talked some time about the matter between
themselves and finally they locked arms,
slowly walked out of the office saying:</p>

<p>“Guess we better cut out swearing all
around.”</p>

<p>The following story illustrates a good method
of treating boys who disobey their parents. It
may not meet the approval of many fathers and
mothers, but the sequel has in it the success of
the work among the street-boys. We regret that
we cannot give due credit to the author for the
suggestions embodied in the story.</p>

<p>A young boy was left alone in the yard to
play. Everybody had gone and left the house in
his care. He was given the key and told not to
enter the house until the family returned. After a
while he became tired of the birds, the flowers, the
the trees, the sunshine. The spirit of disobedience
entered into him and slowly he took his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
way to the house. He unlocked the door. The
first thing met his eye was his father’s razor. He
had always been forbidden to touch it. But the
spirit of license ran riot in his veins, and in using
it he cut his face until the blood trickled down.
Next he made his way to a matchbox. He had
always been told to let it alone. He first built
fences with matches on the floor, then fires under
the lace curtains. A hole in the carpet, ruined
curtains and his fingers blistered was the result.
Suffering with pain and ashamed of his disobedience
he steals out under the trees, and like
Adam in the garden, he thought he could hide
his sins by hiding himself. So he stole away and
crawled under some bushes. When his father
came home, discovered the ruined articles, he
thought, what can be done to restore and mend
that which his boy had broken, had ruined? His
razor was broken, but he could buy a new one.
His matches were consumed, but he could buy
more. The curtains and carpet were defaced by
fire, but they could be replaced and repaired.
Wealth could repair the damage done to the
house and make all as before. Skill and nature
could repair the wrong done to the hand and the
face, and make them as they were before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>But where were the riches and where was the
teacher that could make the boy’s heart as it was
before his disobedience? None could be found.
Let me tell you what happened. The father came
not to upbraid, but to entreat; not to chastise, but
to weep; The child’s hand was burned, the
father’s heart was broken. The boy cried for
shame, the father cried for sorrow. The father
put his arms about the boy and with his head upon
his breast together they sobbed out their sorrow.
One part of it was the boy’s confession, and the
other part of it was the father’s pain. Together
they made a new resolution and hand to hand,
and heart to heart, and love to love, they began
together to repair the ruin that had been
wrought.</p>

<p>During the early stages of a boy’s membership
he is constantly reminded that some day he
will leave the street, he will seek employment
elsewhere, and his start in a business life depends
upon his street work. To illustrate this teaching,
a boy found a small child’s savings bank. It
was filled with money, small coin; and it was
heavy. It was picked up on the street over a mile
from the president’s office. As soon as found, the
boy started on a run, as they always do, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
office. It was delivered with the usual instruction
“to please find the owner.” To try the newsie
the president called him aside and said, in a confidential
whisper: “Why didn’t you sneak around
the corner, into an alley, any place where no one
could see you, and take a stone break the old bank
all to pieces, take the money, and, my, what a
good time you could have had.”</p>

<p>The boy quickly replied: “No, sir, Mr. President,
suppose I wanted a job, and stood in line to
be questioned by the man, and he would ask, have
you always been honest? What would I say?
Why! my face would show I did something
wrong&mdash;I took a little bank from some poor boy,
and he would say, I don’t want a boy I would
have to be afraid of; no that don’t belong to me.”</p>

<p>This plainly shows what can be successfully
impressed upon the minds of these hustling, seemingly
thoughtless, street-boys. And when the
owner of that bank proved to be a little girl&mdash;and
how happy she was when it was found and returned
to her, the boy said: “I would rather have
the girl’s smiles than all the money the bank contained.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<p>From the very beginning of the Boyville association
there has scarcely been a day without
something of importance transpiring among the
boys. It has been gradually building up, incidents
and noble acts showing the willingness of these
boys not only to do right themselves but to assist
others.</p>

<p>The work so humbly begun in 1892, with one
hundred or more members, mostly the poorest
boys of the streets, little outcasts, as they are
often called, developed so rapidly under the self-governing
plan, that in the early part of the year
1905 the books of the Boyville Newsboys’ Association
showed a membership of over three thousand
boys under fourteen years of age. This enrollment
includes two hundred and fifty boys who
started with the association as sellers and shiners
of shoes, but who today have graduated from the
street. The majority of this number are engaged
in some business, lawyers, doctors, commercial
travelers, clerks or working in some trade, and
all ambitious not only to earn a living for themselves
but also to lend a helping hand to those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
who are in need, ever having in mind the teachings
of the association. The following will show
how well some of the principles have been remembered
and how long they remained intact.</p>

<p>Early in January of 1905, a young man
brought to the president an old pocket-book containing
twenty-two dollars and sixty cents ($22.60),
together with some letters, the contents of
which revealed the fact that the owner was a poor
woman and had been visiting her relatives to secure
assistance in raising money to pay taxes,
long since due, on her home. Names were given,
but no residence.</p>

<p>The president said to the young man: “You
know we advertise what the boys find in the daily
papers and do everything we can to seek the
owner and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied the young man, “I know
all this and have been through it many years ago.
That is just what I want you to do, please try to
find the rightful owner. I want no compensation,
and I don’t want my name mentioned in any
way.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">LINING UP READY TO GO TO CHURCH.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>As it was necessary to know who the finder
was, so that after the expiration of thirty days
the money could be returned to him, he finally
gave his name and address. When he had left
the office, something about his eyes reminded the
president that he had seen him, somewhere many
years ago. Bringing out the Newsboys’ book he
found among the first names recorded eleven
years ago, this young man’s. Following the name
was: “Seller, and shiner, age eleven, poor parents,
smart boy,” and on leaving the street, as a
seller, became a graduate member. So, he was a
newsboy eleven years ago, and still retained the
desire to do something for others.</p>

<p>About a week after the money was advertised,
a very aged lady called. She minutely described
the contents of the pocket-book; she said: “I was
returning from a visit to my son, where I went to
get $22.60 to pay taxes on my home. This
amount included some back taxes. The property
was already advertised for sale. What to do
when I lost that money I did not know. My mental
suffering was most intense. I walked from
the depot towards the court house and did not
miss my pocket-book until I crossed the bridge.
Yes, this is mine.”</p>

<p>During the recital of her story her eyes were
filled with tears, and she showed the mental
strain under which she was laboring. When the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
pocket-book and the money were handed to her,
the change in her demeanor was beautiful to behold.
When the young man was told to whom
the money belonged and the great good it did,
he said:</p>

<p>“No money reward could pay me for this. I
am only too glad we found the owner, especially
as it belonged to so poor a woman.”</p>

<p>Does it pay to be a life-member of The Boyville
Newsboys’ Association?</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<p>The finding of valuable articles and turning
them over to the president, with a request to find
the owner, is not a rule of the association.</p>

<p>All these little acts have a tendency to cultivate
a desire to assist others and many times violations
of the rules are corrected by members
who are not officers.</p>

<p>At almost any time of the day can be seen a
man with a two-wheeled cart, slowly circulating
around newspaper offices, especially about the
time the dailies are out. The newsies purchase
a penny’s worth of ice cream, or cheap candies,
and often these old men become quite confidential
friends of certain boys&mdash;particularly the shiners,
who are on the street almost constantly. One
time a new member, a bootblack, a boy about
fourteen years of age, before he understood the
secret workings of the association, had a dispute
with a vendor of ice cream and peanuts, about the
loss of several sacks of peanuts. The boy was
accused of stealing the peanuts. “Yes, you didn’t
see me steal ’em,” said the shiner, “an if you don’t
catch a feller, how youse goin’ to prove it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy was about to leave the wagon, when
several sellers came to him.</p>

<p>“Say, Muddy Water,” cried one of the boys,
“we seed you steal the peanuts. You must settle
wid de ole man.”</p>

<p>The boy came back, but pleaded that he did
not have any money.</p>

<p>“All right, we’ll chip in an’ pay de debt.”</p>

<p>The money was raised, and the boy was required
to pay for the stolen peanuts and make an
apology.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, but I didn’t know it was again’
the rules of the association,” he said.</p>

<p>“Of course it’s again the rules, an’ it’s our
business to give all new members warning when
they do things like that. Don’t do it any more.”</p>

<p>This was a warning well heeded as after
events proved.</p>

<p>One of the greatest benefits gained by the
newsboys in belonging to the association is the
securing of suitable positions; for boys, as they
grow older, naturally leave the street work.</p>

<p>Wholesale as well as retail men, frequently
ask for good, honest boys. During the twelve
years existence of Boyville it has been the delight
of the president to secure some two hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
places for newsboys. With all this great number
it is a pleasure to state that not one in fifty proved
unworthy of the positions, or unfitted for the kind
of work. The majority of boys for whom
positions were secured were from very poor parents,
mostly widowed mothers, needing their
assistance.</p>

<p>Unless a person is familiar with street
boys, no conception can be formed of their energy
and determination in following up anything
they want.</p>

<p>A young man, who had outgrown newsboy’s
work called upon the president and wanted a position
as brakeman on one of the railroads.</p>

<p>He was kindly informed by the president that
he knew the superintendent of the road he wished
to work for had already over five hundred applications
from young men wanting to be brakemen.
Instead of asking the president to see the
superintendent, as is generally done, he said:</p>

<p>“Please give me the name of the man who
does the employing of brakemen. I want to see
him. I think I can show him he wants me.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid it won’t be of any use, but I
like your pluck. Here is a note to him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>This note simply said the bearer was an honest
young man.</p>

<p>A few days later the young man called.</p>

<p>“Well, I got a job. I’m brakeman on one of
the fast trains.”</p>

<p>This he secured through his own tact, for this
certainly was necessary. His street experience
taught him to hustle for himself, and it became
part of his nature as he grew older. He did not
sit down and wait for something to come his way,
for something to turn up. He turned up something
for himself.</p>

<p>His frank and honorable method of working
the superintendent, his earnest but manly appeal,
his push, his politeness, his tact, secured for him
what five hundred young men were “waiting to
receive by letter.” When the matter was referred
to the superintendent he said: “His every action
showed he was a willing worker and not afraid
to work overtime if necessary. He works as
though he owned the entire road.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

<p>Commercial men, some of our best merchants,
sometimes, in their eagerness to make money, forget
the first principles of honesty, and often make
assertions that upon second thought they would
not make. Sometimes in their advertising they
will say things which they would never think of
saying under other circumstances, though lying
in business matters is equally as dishonorable as
in private life. The relations between the public
and the merchant, as well as between master and
servant, must rest on mutual respect and confidence.
Here is an illustration, by a close observer,
a boy fourteen years of age.</p>

<p>Walking along one of the principal streets, a
newsboy noticed the following sign, in large type,
in a show window and attached to some article
for sale. It read: “Regular price, one hundred
dollars. Our price, twenty-nine dollars.”</p>

<p>“Say, president,” said the boy, “is that man
telling the truth when he says a twenty-nine dollar
article is worth one hundred dollars?”</p>

<p>It was a question that required a wise answer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
but put it in any business way possible, nothing
could satisfy the boy that it was strictly honest.</p>

<p>“When I go into business,” said the seller,
“you bet I’ll not fool the public; when I say a
thing is worth so much it will be worth that
much.”</p>

<p>What time would develop, what changes come
over this young man, no one could tell, but the
right principle had a good hold of the boy, and it
meant success and a clear conscience during his
manhood.</p>

<p>That the success of the association does not
depend upon the efforts of the officers entirely,
will be seen by the following:</p>

<p>Three newsboys called upon the president;
two of them were leading a ragged little fellow
with a shining-box thrown over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Say, president,” said one of them, “here’s a
boy shining shoes on the market an’ the way he
swears is puttin’ men out o’ business.”</p>

<p>The accused bootblack was a sight. To the
question where he lived he replied: “I have no
home. My father’s dead an’ my mother, she’s
no good. There’s no room fur me in the house.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>By further questioning it was learned that the
clothes he had on were given to him some two
months ago and had not been taken off since he
put them on. This may seem strange, but it is
only one of the dozen of cases where parents do
not require the removal of their boy’s clothes
when they go to bed.</p>

<p>The peculiar odor coming from boys who are
treated in this shameful manner will prove this.
This boy walked from a neighboring city, or stole
a ride on some freight-train. He had been shining
shoes around the market-space for a month
or more, and declared that to be in the push, to
be recognized by men, and to secure business, it
was necessary to swear and be tough.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be a bootblack,” he said, “if I
couldn’t swear, the men wouldn’t shine if I
didn’t.”</p>

<p>The newsboys who frequented the market
were very much put out by this boy’s swearing
and general tough appearance, so when opportunity
favored they began their missionary work,
with the result of persuading the shiner to accompany
them to the president’s office.</p>

<p>The boy had a very attractive face. He was
worth saving.</p>

<p>“So, you come to see me about joining the association,”
said the president.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy replied: “The boys say I can make
more money if I cut out swearin’ an’ belong to
the association.”</p>

<p>“They tell me you swear and sometimes don’t
know how to give correct change to your customers.
If that’s so you are just the kind of a boy
we want. You little hustling fellows make our
best young men. You don’t wait until someone
comes to you for a shine. I have seen you follow
a man who had red shoes a whole square. You
will make a good business man, and these little
boys, friends of yours, are just the kind of boys
who will help you, will bring you business, will
tell you where to get something good to eat, and
I think we can throw away your old ragged
clothes and get a new suit, how would you like
that?”</p>

<p>His face had a surprised look. He didn’t expect
some one to offer anything of interest to
him, he expected to get lectured, to be “talked
goodygood to,” as he afterwards said.</p>

<p>“Well, you see, mister,” said the boy with
some familiarity, “we can’t do business on the
street unless we do as men do. They swear at
us an’ we must swear at them or we lose the
shine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>“How often do men swear at you?”</p>

<p>“How often? I can’t count ’em. Every other
word.”</p>

<p>“Well, it doesn’t sound nice, does it?”</p>

<p>“No, an’ I could cut it out.”</p>

<p>“Sure thing he can cut it out, an’ we’ll be
right behind to see that he forgets it,” put in one
of the newsies.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll start you in the association,” said
the president, “but I don’t want you to be too
good to start with. Sometimes you may forget
what the card means, and you will swear before
you know it, but don’t let that worry you, the next
time you will do better and forget it. But when
you get the badge, in thirty days, then you mustn’t
swear at all, for if you do the officers will be right
after you and your name will be on a list that
means something when you get older and want
a position in some big store.”</p>

<p>The membership card was given to him, a
new suit of clothes was furnished by a kind
hearted clothier, and the boys&mdash;including the
chairman of the executive committee&mdash;took the
boy home. When his mother discovered some one
took an interest in him, she began to think he
amounted to something, and from that time on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
he received attention. At the expiration of thirty
days the numbered badge was given to him and
he started on his new life.</p>

<p>In the fall of the same year this bootblack
was unanimously elected as an officer of Boyville,
and is one of the best boys on the street. Two
months later he brought to the president a gold
watch, worth forty-two dollars and fifty cents.
The owner was found, and insisted upon seeing
the young man. He was sent, with the watch, to
him. The wealthy lawyer handed him ten cents,
and gave him some good advice. The boy returned
the money saying:</p>

<p>“No, Mister, you keep this, you need it more
than I do.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<p>Among the great number of boys who called
at the office, none cast such a ray of sunshine
about him as a little seller known as Sunny Willie,
on account of the smile he always seemed to have.
But with all his good nature and kindness of
heart, he, at times, became very serious.</p>

<p>One evening after the boys had sold their papers
and were enroute to their homes, Sunny
Willie, as was often his habit, called upon the
president to say good night. Just as he was leaving
the office, two boys walked in and the loud
talking between them indicated trouble. Willie
concluded to remain. Leaning against the desk
he became a very attentive listener. The smile
had left him. He looked thoughtful.</p>

<p>“I know you’re wrong,” said one of the boys,
“you’re talking to hear yourself talk. You are
looking fur trouble. That’s what you are. I ken
prove it. I ken show you I wasn’t on the corner
fur a week.” “That’s right,” replied the other
boy, “why wasn’t you there fur a week, because
you stole the papers from the poor old woman and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
was ashamed to sell ’round the corner. Now,
come off, you took de papers.”</p>

<p>At the corner of the post-office is a small stand
kept by a woman, who has been engaged in selling
papers for a number of years. One morning,
some papers were missing from a bundle lying
upon the sidewalk. The boy accused usually sold
papers on the corner and his absence for several
mornings gave rise to the suspicion that he either
took the papers or knew something about them.</p>

<p>“As I said before,” continued the accused boy,
“I did not steal the papers, an’ you got no proof
to show I did.”</p>

<p>There was silence for some moments when
Sunny Willie, said, in a whisper, to the president:</p>

<p>“I saw de kid take the papers. Shall I butt
in?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you arbitrate the case&mdash;settle it,” replied
the president.</p>

<p>The usual smile was still missing when Willie
said, quietly:</p>

<p>“Sand the track, you’re slipping.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked the boy, his face
becoming very red.</p>

<p>“You know the rule of the association is to
warn a boy when he’s slipping; when he’s doin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>’
something wrong. When I say, sand the track,
I mean you can’t go forward, you go backward,
and some one must help you or you slide back,
see? I’m the fellow who’s ready to stop you from
sliding. I saw you take the papers.”</p>

<p>The accused was surprised. He could not
talk. Sunny Willie again came to his rescue.</p>

<p>“I’ll give you these pennies,” he said, and the
smile returned to his pretty face. In his little
hand he held ten new pennies.</p>

<p>“Now, didn’t you take the papers?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I intended to return the money for
them, or make it all right with the old woman.”</p>

<p>“Come,” he continued addressing Willie, “I’ll
go with you and we’ll make it all right.”</p>

<p>Out the three boys went and they were soon
talking with the old woman. Shortly, Sunny
Willie returned to the office.</p>

<p>“If I hadn’t a put sand on his track he would
have slipped way back,” he said to the president,
“Everything’s all right. He will never steal papers
again.”</p>

<p>Another little seller, a favorite on the street
among business men, one of whom the president
often purchases a paper to please the newsboy,
came running into the office one evening and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
throwing his bundle upon the lap of the president
said:</p>

<p>“Here, pres., hold these papers until I go into
the hotel to get a drink of water.”</p>

<p>The act was done so quickly the president
found the big bundle on his lap before he really
understood the wishes of the newsie, but he
quickly returned, took the papers, and said, as he
hastened out:</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. President.”</p>

<p>The confidence this boy had in the president
was appreciated, not only by him but by those
who witnessed the act.</p>

<p>It has always been a source of great pleasure,
to the president and his associates, to see how
deeply interested the officers of the association
become, as the following will show.</p>

<p>Three officers were walking on one of the principal
streets casually looking in the show-windows
when they heard music; looking ahead they saw a
newsboy, a seller, walking along, playing a
mouth-organ. Coming to him, it was noticed the
instrument was an unusually fine one, and a new
one.</p>

<p>“That mouth-organ is too expensive for that
boy, there’s something wrong,” said one of the
officers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where did you get that organ,” was asked
the newsie.</p>

<p>“I buyed it at Smith’s store, down yonder,”
was the reply.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess, not. You never had so much
money. Come on with us and show us where
you bought it.”</p>

<p>They walked to the corner when the boy said:</p>

<p>“I didn’t buy it there, I bought it down on
Monroe street,” giving the correct name of a
store on that street.</p>

<p>“All, right, come along, we’ll go down there.”</p>

<p>Around the corner they started and when
within a block of the street the boy again changed
the place of purchase.</p>

<p>“I buyed it of Mr. Jones, way out on this
street.”</p>

<p>That was five blocks away.</p>

<p>“Now this is the last time,” said one of the
officers, “if you change the place again, look out.”</p>

<p>But when they had walked four squares the
boy again made an effort to change.</p>

<p>“No, you don’t my chappy,” said one of the
officers, “We know you stole it. We knew it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
from the first. Now you own to the truth or we
will take you to the president, and then what?”</p>

<p>The boy squirmed considerable, but every
movement gave evidence that he stole it.</p>

<p>“Now, where did you get it?” was bluntly
asked, as the boy was backed up against a building.</p>

<p>This was too much for him. He owned he
“hooked it.” Naming a prominent department
store as the place he took it.</p>

<p>“You must go with us, hand it to the proprietor
and beg his pardon,” said the officers.</p>

<p>This at first seemed a most difficult task, but
when they promised to accompany him to the
store he agreed.</p>

<p>When at the door of the great store he asked
the officers to step aside.</p>

<p>“If I do this you will not tell the president,
will you?”</p>

<p>“Of course not, he shall never know anything
about it.”</p>

<p>He walked in, took an elevator and soon stood
before the manager of the store.</p>

<p>He told how he saw it on the counter and
“hooked it when the girls were not looking, but
I will never do anything like this again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>The manager thanked the boy for his determination
to do better and told him he would forgive
him for the theft, and promised to give him
a position in the store if the officers of the association
would bring him there when he was
through school.</p>

<p>The president learned of this incident a month
later but never knew the name of the newsboy.</p>

<p>As has been said, the boys are continually suggesting
by their acts and words, something new,
something whereby the officers can build upon
their ideas.</p>

<p>The membership cards were given first, to
show the boys some of the written rules; and,
second, that the boys might have something official
to show in case they lost their badges; but a
new idea suggested itself to one of the graduating
sellers, who was about to engage in business
other than selling papers. A prominent churchman
advertised, “a boy wanted in his manufacturing
concern.” This young man saw the advertisement
and became an applicant for the position.
He was received very kindly and naturally
so because he had an honest face, and was a willing
worker. The gentleman asked if the boy
could give any reference.</p>

<p>The newsboy took from his pocket a membership
card of the Boyville Newsboys’ Association.</p>

<p>“Do you know any thing about the association
of newsboys?” asked the seller.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I know all about them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>“This is my reference,” the boy replied handing
him the card on which the man read&mdash;“He
does not approve of swearing, stealing, lying etc.”</p>

<p>To the boy’s surprise and disgust, the gentleman
took the card crumpled it in his hand, and
threw it upon the floor, remarking: “that’s no
reference&mdash;that’s no good in business.”</p>

<p>The boy picked it up, and, to use his own language,
said:</p>

<p>“I waited until my temper cooled down and
I asked him, ‘can you say you never swore, never
stole any thing, never gambled, never cheated any
one? I can, sir, and that’s what that card means.
I wouldn’t work for you.’ Oh, I hit him hard.
As I was leaving he called me back, but I said,
‘if you would give me five thousand dollars a year
I wouldn’t work for you. You have not only insulted
me but the association.’”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>

<p>Before Boyville was thought of, a personal investigation
into the home-life of over a hundred
boys was made, and this covered a period of three
years. Of the one hundred who were graduating
from the street work as newsboys not more
than thirty were engaged in a business that would
lead them to fortune or fame. Seventy were satisfied
with making a living by earnings of vice
and petty crimes. It was learned that a boy who
was permitted to go on in his own way would have
no useful training for later work. The seventy
boys followed the rule of men in wrong-doing.
“No man is guilty until caught,” is the general
rule of men who make it a business of stealing.</p>

<p>The progress of any humanitarian legislation
is gradual.</p>

<p>No one ever stopped to make inquiry about a
newsboy. He lived in a business, and social circle,
all by himself. He was left to shift for himself
and in a most unequal battle.</p>

<p>When investigation revealed the deplorable
fact that seventy per cent. of our newsboys were
being educated and trained with their faces towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
jails and penitentiaries, the question arose,
how can we reduce this number, how can we turn
their faces towards a better life, a happier condition,
a delightful ending? How make them honorable
citizens, good men, loved by all who know
them, an honor to themselves, to their parents,
their friends, the State and city in which they
live?</p>

<p>The problem solved itself in personal experiences,
convincing us that we must try to catch
the candidates for prison before they have been
debased and to keep them decent. “It is the
Christian, decent, brotherly way for one thing,
and it is the cheapest way in dollars and cents for
another.”</p>

<p>It is a rule, rather than an exception, that
people have always considered a newsboy bad, and
he is therefore treated accordingly.</p>

<p>Everybody knows or can soon learn to know,
that the street is the great school of crime. Betting
and gambling are typical of the combination
of work and play of man and boy that street work
produces.</p>

<p>One of the greatest evils of the street was that
of begging; of boys working on the sympathies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
of the public by taking advantage of men and
women on street-cars or in public places.</p>

<p>Some boys made a business of begging, the
majority not from their own choice, but by compulsion
of their parents.</p>

<p>One boy in particular was doing more to injure
the success of the association’s work on the
street than hundreds of others who were bad in
other lines.</p>

<p>The father of this boy would wait until the
theatres were out, at night, and instruct the boy
to “work the car,” by begging, and if that failed
by forcing papers upon young men who were
compelled to purchase what they did not want.</p>

<p>It took some time, almost a year, to stop this
kind of business, and then the president had to
call upon the efficient Humane officer to stop it.
As every case of begging was traced to the fault
of parents the Humane Society had to deal directly
with them.</p>

<p>The Boyville association gradually stamped
this evil entirely out.</p>

<p>To stop begging, stealing, swearing and
gambling, four leading street evils among the
newsboys and in guiding the footsteps of these
little wanderers, for this they are when seen upon
the streets of our great cities, that Boyville came
into existence, and it is to co-operate, when it
is possible or desirable, with the parents and the
home in reclaiming boys who have gone astray or
are likely to follow paths that lead to ruin.</p>

<p>There is no greater, stronger sign of love to
young or old than when a friend gives a warning
in the right spirit.</p>

<p>The children of Israel had no better friend
than Moses, and when they obeyed his warning
they never went astray. We may be wrong in
our liberal methods of giving to charity; we may
be wrong in dropping pennies into the hats of
the street beggars&mdash;the blind&mdash;the lame&mdash;the
crippled who stand or sit on our public streets
pleading in a tone of experience; and we may
be satisfying an ever-warning conscience; but
there is one thing certain, we can never make a
mistake by warning a newsboy from doing anything
wrong&mdash;from stealing, lying, swearing, or
gambling, and it is always wise and safe to give
a boy the right start in life.</p>

<p>In every city, with a population of one hundred
thousand or more, thirty per cent. of the
newsboys, the sellers, have no homes or their
homes are worse than none at all. If men and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
women would stop to think, to investigate, listen
to the stories as told by these street boys; of the
wants, miseries and degradation in the sad conditions
that surround many of them; these dirty,
ragged boys would receive a more Christian-like
attention and care. If your nature to mingle with
the meek and lowly is forced, if your mission for
doing good in this world is cast in other fields,
where better results may be reached, you can take
a personal interest in seeing that those who are
familiar with work among street boys, and who
delight in trying to aid them, are given proper
encouragement and assistance so that their work
may be carried on successfully.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>

<p>A few months’ experience with boys who
spend most of their lives upon the street, and pride
themselves on being tough, will teach one a great
lesson. You will learn you cannot reach a boy
unless you get near him, are of his kind; and the
most lasting and truest friendship, and through
which you can gain the best results, is where you
place a boy under personal obligations to you,
through kindness. You may buy him for money,
but he does not look upon you with the same interest
and confidence as when you gain his love
through personal attention. The boy must be understood.
No two boys are alike. Though many
are endowed with similar characteristics, each has
his own individuality. The trees are not all of
one kind. Even the leaves on the same tree differ
in size and contour. One tree in the writer’s
yard, one of the choicest of plums; a long branch
sprouted out every spring and grew so rapidly
that before the leaves in the fall began to show
signs of decay, it became strong and reached
several feet beyond any other branch. It made
the tree look awkward, unnatural, but when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
trimmed down, even with the others, it produced
more and better fruit than any other portion of
the tree. The boys are like the birds who are unlike
in plumage and song; the flowers in color
and fragrance, and yet nature would not be
perfect were it not for these different lines of
beauty, strength, and fragrance.</p>

<p>In the cultivation of plants the gardner considers
the nature and needs of different stages of
growth, furnishing the nourishment and care that
will be most helpful just at that time. So in boyhood
we observe various stages of development,
whose natures and needs must be studied that we
may properly provide for them.</p>

<p>It has been said: “That the home, the church,
the school with their natural and uplifting influences
have been responsible in the past, and must
continue to be in the future, for the manhood and
womanhood of this nation.” It is a well-known
fact that the home sometimes fails, or there is no
home, or one which the church and the school do
not reach. There are times when even these have
no power over a boy’s acts. A boy who violates
the laws of the land is answerable not to the home,
the church or the school, but to the State.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>Crime among boys, in America, is greatly on
the increase. The reports, official and unofficial,
that are made public, of the per cent. of the criminals
serving time in our jails, workhouses, reform
schools, and even our penitentiaries, are astounding,
and almost beyond belief.</p>

<p>How to check this is a problem of the greatest
importance, and it cannot be solved without
the hearty co-operation of every person.</p>

<p>Among the first things to be done must be
the recognition of the power of home and our
neighbors. We cannot live without our neighbor.
Each home depends upon some other home; and
when the boy leaves his home to go upon the
street, he is at once overcome by the stronger
power and influence of a boy of some other home,
and, perhaps where the rearing and training was
not good. The boy is a result more or less, of all
influences and environment of the lives of his
companions. Every good mother recalls the pang
that came over her heart when for the first time
she led her boy to school, knowing that her influence
must be shared with that of the teacher.
It is not long until the boy quotes his teacher, and
sometimes in defiance, when he says: “My teacher
says so an’ so.” And how many times we hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
this from the boy when away from home, more
frequently than the sayings of his mother. The
boy’s school life soon begins to develop self-reliance,
full of possibilities, of curiosity and questionings,
the period of formation of thoughts,
feelings and desires. And when a boy reaches
that stage in his life when he is permitted to go
down town alone&mdash;he at once begins a new life.
And there is not a mother in our country but
who makes this pleading request to her son as he
is about to start: “Don’t go into bad company.”</p>

<p>It is on this line that the Newsboys’ Association,
with all its varied interests and objects,
through its many channels of work, backed with
that true spirit of Christianity characteristic of
everything that means good, with the aid of its
president and its many working officers, in the
name of God and humanity, aims to make the
bad boy of the streets of our cities and towns
good, so that the mother will not find it necessary
to say: “Now, my dear son, don’t go into bad
company.”</p>

<p>Let us all hope, and pray, and work for the
time to come when there will be no “bad company”
on the streets.</p>

<p>At one of the auxiliary meetings the question
was asked a carrier, why the association “kicked
against drinking whiskey when my father drinks
four times a day.” In a talk at the meeting the
vice-president said: “Your father may have been
a respected citizen. He was all right when he
started out, but today he is a physical wreck, I
know him. He drinks too much. He paid no attention
to warning. Perhaps he had no one to
tell him. He trembles now, and I have seen him
fall to the ground, helpless. Some day he will
fall and get up no more. Every boy has in his
mind a real desire to do good, but if you start in
life as a whiskey drinker, if you stand around and
see your friends drink without giving them a
warning, some day you will regret it, something
will come up in your life to remind you of your
carelessness, your lost opportunity to help a fellow
being, and his ruin means more to you than you
think it does.</p>

<p>“There was a man once rowing in a small boat
above Niagara Falls, where the water was quiet.
He got funny and ventured down stream too far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
until he got into the current and not having
strength enough to pull out of it, he was going
faster and every second he saw certain destruction
ahead of him. It was too late for him to
think and act. The thinking should have been
done up the river on peaceful waters. So you
boys better do your thinking now if you don’t
want to follow that kind of people over the brink.
No, boys, don’t drink intoxicating liquors, don’t
start it, cut it out, forget it.</p>

<p>“We do not believe that temperance is really
promoted by compulsion, but this we do know,
that the boy who will let whiskey and all spirits
alone is very fortunate, and has a bright, happy
future. He is the boy who will succeed; he is
the young man that is wanted; he will be the man
to be trusted.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>

<p>The problem of the boy is a great one, and
the more we have to do with his life upon the
street the greater the task of solution becomes.
It is said that two great factors make the sum of
human life&mdash;heredity and environment. We are
told that if you will gather up soil from the arctic
regions and carry it on a steamer southward, you
will soon see it covered with vegetation. If the
soil of the tropics is taken to the frozen regions of
Franz Joseph Land, it will become barren. The
soil of both regions is full of heredity, but the
difference of environment greatly modifies the
result. There are in all of us hereditary tendencies
to both vice and virtue, and under favorable
surroundings, these tendencies will be either dormant
or developed.</p>

<p>A thief may come from a morally healthy family,
a happy prosperous home, but he is an unhealthy
exception not the rule. It is the offense
of our day that the tendency of life is toward destruction
of character. The crowding of population
to the cities, is gradually destroying the home
feeling. This rapidly increasing rush from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
country and small towns to the centres of individual
energy, brings a dependent class of boys,
and the official reports show a significant increase
in the number of juvenile criminals, from
small towns, and also that they are much younger
than formerly. This does not mean that the energetic
young man of the country should stay
away from the cities, or should not seek employment
or business in a city; it simply means that
christian people should take a greater personal
interest in trying to make the boy good before he
leaves his home, and that the city people should
make city life purer.</p>

<p>So long as our best reputed citizens, the first
men of many of our churches, own the dilapidated
tenement houses, receiving from such occupants a
rental sufficient to pay taxes, and without caring
who occupies the premises or for what purposes,
the criminal tendency must increase.</p>

<p>For a time charitably-inclined people may
check and partially correct an evil, but the tendency
will remain, sure to assert itself in one
form or another. If the present cheap-John tenements
should be wiped out, and it were made
possible for the proper classes to secure homes in
the country, modest as necessarily they would be,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
it would go a long way towards correcting one
of the greatest evils of the day.</p>

<p>“The prison returns of one of our great States
show that fifty per cent. of all young criminals
come from bad homes, from tenement houses
owned by rich men, and only nine per cent. from
good homes.”</p>

<p>Since the Humane societies are so well organized,
and doing such magnificent work, much
may be expected for the better in the condition
of the houses of the poor. There are many streets
in our great cities where people shudder when
compelled to walk, on account of their bad reputation.</p>

<p>The tenants may be bad, but are they worse
than the owners of the property? Have you ever
stopped to think who owns a building under
whose roof lives a dozen bad characters?</p>

<p>One Sunday morning, a gentleman in the city
was walking down an avenue of considerable
importance when he was surprised to see two
young newsboys coming out of the rear door of
a saloon, each trying to keep the other from falling
to the ground.</p>

<p>The building was old and rickety. On the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
floor were not a half dozen whole panes of
glass in eight window frames.</p>

<p>Astonished at this, a question was asked, of
a passer-by who owned the saloon property?</p>

<p>“Mr.&mdash;&mdash; owns all the property on that
side of the street. He is now teaching a Sunday-school
class while boys are in his building drinking.
This thing’s repeated every Sunday. It’s
headquarters for young men.”</p>

<p>When our leading men of business, our wealthy
citizens, men of influence, men who stand
high in the commercial world, are renting their
property to persons who, for the money they
make, are ruining hundreds of young lives, what
can we expect?</p>

<p>We need an era of enforcement of law, less
of pretense, more of purpose. Whether the laws
be good or bad, is not a question. If they are
good, they should be enforced for the welfare of
the community and the vindication of the State.
If they are bad, they should be enforced so that
their injustice may prove sufficiently oppressive
to lead to their appeal.</p>

<p>The saloons will always be with us, and so
long as the State, and the city receive the price for
their existence, and grant them recognition and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
endorsement, they should be protected in accordance
with the laws governing their business, but
beyond all this, there is a law, a moral law, a law
of decency, of respect, for the welfare and happiness
of mankind, that should appeal to every
man engaged in the selling of liquors.</p>

<p>Five men, of our acquaintance, engaged in
the saloon business, have for many years mutually
agreed to do certain things. They do not
open their places of business on Sunday. They
do not admit a minor into their saloons for any
cause. They will not sell liquor to a man who
shows the least sign of being intoxicated.</p>

<p>If every man engaged in the saloon business
would follow to the letter these few simple rules,
thousands of good wives, and innocent children
would be happy, and the influence for good could
not be estimated. Our Sunday-closing laws
should be enforced.</p>

<p>The lives of a majority of men, hard-working
men, are dreary enough for six days of the week
without having all of the desolation compressed
into the seventh and drilled into them through
the avarice of selfish men who aim to take advantage
of a man under the influence of liquor, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
take from him his last cent and then throw him
into the street.</p>

<p>We are learning to regard the majority of
youthful offenders, especially in our large cities,
as the victims of environment, sufferers from lack
of opportunity for good. In nine cases out of
ten, boys who are found in saloons come from
well-to-do families, and are permitted to be there
through neglect and carelessness of their parents.</p>

not more frequently attend church services. May
not one of these reasons be traced to neglect and
carelessness on the part of the parents? Nothing
in the religious world can be more important
than the proper training of young men. It is said
that the only place where real religion can be
taught is in the home. By this it is not meant
religious forms, but real religion. To go to
church every Sunday and sing religious
hymns and listen to eloquent sermons is
not all there is to religion. The formation of
character, the stimulus of the moral sentiments
must be done largely outside of the doors of the
church. To assist in building up the boy who
roams our streets at will, and to take an interest
in and to encourage the boy to live up to and follow
the instructions he receives at his home, is,
indeed, to practice real religion.</p>

<p>It is a well-known fact, often repeated by the
guards at our penitentiaries, that no man ever
entered these institutions but what at sometime
or other declared that, if he had followed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
admonition and religious instructions of his father
and mother, his life would have been different.
If father and mother do not practice in their
daily lives this real religion, and if the boy is not
brought up to believe that some people are to be
avoided, and held in contempt, all the churches
in the world cannot correct such mistakes, because
they have but few hours one day in a week
to accomplish what six days can undo.</p>

<p>It will be seen, then, how important it is that
the boy on the street, whether he comes from a
good religious home or a bad home, should be
watched and carefully guided and taught.</p>

<p>Our work in the garden is not to pull out onions,
radishes, tomato plants, but carefully to destroy
the weeds, and not only those weeds that
are crowding the tender plants, but all weeds.
Get the wild sprouts out, pull up the weeds by the
roots and throw them away. This a good gardener
will do, and he will carefully pull the soft,
rich earth around the plants to brace them up.</p>

<p>If the same interest is taken in our newsboys,
to pull out the weeds so that the boy can grow,
it will be doing what the preacher often says:
“A good man’s goodness lies not hid in himself
alone; but when he endeavors to strengthen his
weaker brother.”</p>

<p>Men often lose great opportunities to assist
their fellow-men through neglect, through carelessness
and indifference. It is so easy to say,
“you have my sympathy, you are doing a noble
work,” when many times the speaker may be
better adapted for the same kind of work and be
far more successful. And so an opportunity is
allowed to slip by all for the lack of taking advantage
of it.</p>

<p>The influence a man or a woman teacher has
over a boy is wonderful. In the eyes of a boy, a
teacher stands for a model of perfection and is
supposed to be in reality, in daily life and actions,
what he seems to be when he shows his best side
to the pupils.</p>

<p>From the school, from the teacher, from a
trusted friend, the boy carries the influence back
to the family, into his daily life upon the streets,
and many of the teachings follow him through
life. The boy at school is taught to be kind, to be
generous, and to remember his little friends
whenever opportunity favors. Heartfelt sympathy
in a newsboy, comes like a flash of lightning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
and he is ever ready to fall in line when the boys
want to remember a friend. The president was
taken by surprise one day when the street sellers,
the poorest of our newsboys, through one of their
hustlers, presented him with a gold badge. The
money to purchase it was raised by subscriptions
from the boys, in amounts ranging from two cents
to twenty-five. A few days after the presentation
the president was walking on one of the main
streets when he was accosted by a little seller,
from the opposite side of the street.</p>

<p>“Say, president, come over here.”</p>

<p>A boy never called the president to go where
he wanted him to go but he complied at once, and
cheerfully. The little ragged fellow stepped in
front of him and said:</p>

<p>“Pres., have youse got de gold badge we gives
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, here it is,” and the badge was taken
from the coat and handed to the boy. Looking at
it closely, and calling several companions to him,
he said:</p>

<p>“Pres., youse see that diamond in the center?”
pointing a dirty finger to it.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, we all see it, and it’s a beauty.”</p>

<p>“Well, you see,” he said straightening up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
above his natural height, “I subscribed four cents
to this here badge, and all the boys put up the
dough. When I went home and thought it over,
I says to myself, we ought to have a bigger badge
than this fur our president. So when I comes
down town I see de boys and we concluded to have
a diamond put in the center. It met wid de kids
’proval, and it was done. You see de diamond?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied a dozen voices.</p>

<p>“Well, I blowed eleven cents in it,” he proudly
replied. Adding, “Ain’t it a bird?”</p>

<p>Happy youth.</p>

<p>How many prayers have been offered for the
salvation of the slums; how many sighs and expressions
of regret and sympathy have been
given, by well-meaning people, for the “poor and
unhealthy boys of the slums.”</p>

<p>Those who are familiar, and it is to be regretted
that they are so few, with the real conditions
of these, supposed, unhealthy and certainly
unpleasant districts, will substantiate the
declaration that the boys who live there, in these
ill-favored spots, and who have followed the vocation
of selling papers or shining shoes, until
they arrived at that age when it was necessary
to seek other and more lucrative employment,
are ninety per cent. healthier and stronger and
better able to fight disease than boys raised in the
most sanitary districts and in wealthy families.
The slums of Whitechapel and Westminster, in
London, inhabitated by a squalid and criminal
population, as well as the slums in New York and
other American cities, maintain a healthier condition
among the inhabitants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>In a period of six years, with an enrollment
of two hundred and fifty newsboys, who belonged
to the sellers auxiliary; a majority of them living
in what is called “the worst part of the city, the
most unhealthy; the most degraded; the most undesirable,”
and boys who from necessity were
compelled to sell papers or shine shoes, thus requiring
an almost daily appearance upon the
streets in all kinds of weather, there were but
three cases of sickness, and but one death, and
this death was caused by an explosion at a Fourth
of July celebration.</p>

<p>Little Barney Frank, one of the brightest and
most promising members of the association died
January 28, 1903, having been injured by a toy
cannon.</p>

<p>The president attended the funeral of this
little boy and being asked to say something touching
the life of his friend, he said:</p>

<p>“Barney was an exceptionally bright and
happy boy, loved by his companions, and almost
worshiped by his heart-broken parents. His
happy disposition, his smiles and great interest
in his fellow newsboys will live forever in the
hearts of those who knew him. It is often asked
why are the young and innocent taken from us?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Some of us believe that the road to heaven opens
wide to welcome little boys.</p>

<p>“One of the most pleasing remembrances of
Barney’s life was shown in the following incident.
It was a cold November evening, with a heavy
fall of rain and sleet. I was standing in the street
looking for a car to take me home, when little
Barney came running to me and said: ‘You go
in the store, in a dry place, I’ll watch for the car
and I’ll call you,’ and in spite of protestations, he
stood in the rain until the car passed. So it was
always with Barney, ever looking after the happiness
of his friends.”</p>

<p>They took the remains to another town, and
buried him in a village graveyard. There he rests
in peace. In summer the grass grows green and
the daisies and violets keep watch; and in a tree,
whose branches shade the unmarked grave, there
comes a robin red-breast, and every morning at
the rising of the sun, and every evening just as
the sun is sinking behind the hills, he sings his
song of love.</p>

<p>Who knows but that it is an angel who comes
to the grave of that little newsboy?</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>

<p>After more than fifteen years’ experience
among the newsboys we can say with considerable
force, that the only way to give substantial
assistance to the poor boy is to give him a start
in life, helping him to work his own way through
a hundred little temptations that would easily lead
him wrong. Today Boyville Association boasts
that it has driven from the streets of a great city
all kinds of begging, gambling, swearing, smoking
cigarettes, and instead of insulting, impudent
newsboys, we have the finest lot of gentlemanly
young business men in the world.</p>

<p>How to carry on successfully work of this
kind, with results as previously stated, is the desire
and wish of thousands of people in our country
today. A person must bring himself in touch
with the boy, he must learn his ways, his habits,
by so doing he learns the best way to approach
him and gain his confidence. This done, the rest
is easy, because the boy works with you and you
simply guide.</p>

<p>Education cannot be given, it must be
achieved, and the value of an education lies not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
only in the possession, but also in the struggle to
secure it.</p>

<p>Everybody knows that the infallible receipt
for happiness, is to do good, and under the right
conditions it is as natural for character to become
beautiful as for a flower. In scores of instances it
has been seen that the principles early established
in the minds of the street-boys, especially where
they are watched by their companions, and
warned when they do something wrong, leave a
lasting impression that time cannot efface.</p>

<p>Life is full of opportunities for the young man
to do good, and if in his early career he begins
to do right it soon becomes part of his life. The
street-boys who first join the association are so
gradually led into the good fellowship of their
own making that the toughest natures thaw out,
they are subjugated, submit cheerfully to the controlling
powers of truth and honesty. Their manners
soften, their words become more gentle and
their actions show a willingness to be little gentlemen.
The good that is in them is brought out
by their own unselfish acts, and the hidden sleeping
humanity bursts into a fuller life.</p>

<p>Today it takes a high order of men to succeed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>With the world as a competitor, where profits
are figured by fractions, it requires young men
of brains, combined with hard common sense,
men of good moral characters, and a willingness
to work.</p>

<p>For a young man to reach a rich inheritance
he must work; he must remember that the root
qualities of character are sobriety, industry, unselfish
economy, and he must be honest in all
that the word implies. Swearing, stealing,
grafting inclinations, expecting something for
nothing, smoking cigarettes or drinking intoxicating
liquors will prevent securing good positions.</p>

<p>Already some of our great railroad systems
will not employ a young man who drinks intoxicating
liquors, or smokes cigarettes; and some go
so far as to forbid swearing while on duty.</p>

<p>To gain this rich inheritance, to build up the
boy who has no chance in life, who, in many
cities, is regarded as a sort of a pest, something
to be kicked and cuffed out of the way, is the great
aim of the Boyville Newsboys’ Association. It
is a kindergarten in the great school of business
and citizenship, and many years experience proves
conclusively not only that the boy of the street is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
capable of conquering himself, and of mastering
his own will-power, but also that he can assist his
companions, to be honest, patriotic, and self-reliant.</p>

<p>Many a boy goes astray simply because home
lacks sunshine. If home is the place where faces
are sour and words harsh, and the boy is continually
hampered with don’ts and censures, he will
spend as many hours as possible elsewhere. A
personal investigation of twenty homes of boys
who were upon the streets a greater portion of
their time, especially at meal hours or after nine
o’clock at night, revealed the fact that nine boys
were away from their homes on account of there
being no restriction on the part of the parents.
These nine families did not know, did not care, at
what hour their sons returned at night, or whether
they were at home at meal hours or not.</p>

<p>Home should keep in sympathy with a boy.
His little troubles, his sorrows are made much
easier and lighter through attention and sympathy,
and if the boy can’t get this at home he will
go elsewhere; and he will often find it in society
he would otherwise shun. No boy ever grows too
old for love. And should the boy seek companionship
in our crowded streets and discover some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
one in whom he can place confidence, his whole
life is wrapped up in that love.</p>

<p>In the Boyville Association it has always been
the rule that, no matter how great a wrong committed
by a boy, and the fine or sentence be what
it may, if the boy looks forward to doing better,
to putting his whole soul into trying to do right,
if he hates and despises the act committed, that
boy has a right to be honorably reinstated, and is
heartily welcomed back to his friends.</p>

<p>“Often” says a thoughtful writer, “men and
women mourn over past wrong-doings with
which their present identity has no connection.”</p>

<p>A good preacher once asked a despondent soul,
whose life was shadowed by a wrong committed
in early years: “Would you do the same thing
again?”</p>

<p>“Do it again?” answered the man, “No, a
thousand times, no.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said the preacher, “You have outgrown
the conditions that caused the wrong-doing,
and you are no longer responsible for it.”</p>

<p>The best way to correct wrong-doing is to
prevent it, to warn a boy against the evil vices
that tend to his ruin in later years. And one way
to prevent crime is to reward virtue.</p>

<p>Hon. Ben. B. Lindsey, of Denver, Colorado,
Judge of the County and Juvenile Court of Denver,
after many years of hard work, intermingled
with the kind of experience that brings good results,
declares that in the work of the Juvenile
Court he has found a way to make our boys of
today, who are inclined to be bad, follow paths of
virtue and honesty that will lead them to good
and honorable citizenship, and his success has
been along the same self-governing plan of the
Boyville Association.</p>

<p>We do not think there has been a more interesting
official report nor one of so great a value
to the thinking people as the publication of “The
Problem of the Children and How the State of
Colorado Cares for them,” by Hon. Ben. B. Lindsey.</p>

<p>“Power under any law,” writes Judge Lindsey,
“may be abused. Mistakes under any law
may be made. No system is perfect. If any conceives
the idea that the Juvenile Court was created
for the purpose of correcting or reforming
every disorderly child, they are, of course, mistaken.
Jails and criminal courts never did that.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
On the contrary, criminality among the youth of
this country has been amazingly on the increase.
Over half of the inmates of jails, reformatories
and prisons combined are under twenty-four
years of age. They are there largely because of
uncorrected delinquency in childhood. While the
Juvenile Court and probation system will not,
and cannot, entirely overcome delinquency and
waywardness, it will do a great deal better than
the jail and criminal court ever did. The Juvenile
Court generally deals with cases in which
there has been a failure in the home, the school,
and often the church. These three institutions
are the places through their various influences to
form the character of the child. The Juvenile
Court is rather an aid to the home and the school
in the moral training of the child. If these two
latter fail, the court, through its officers, can supply
the deficiency. In the Denver Juvenile Court
none are convicted of crime or subjected to the
contamination of the jail.</p>

<p>“The Juvenile Court does not tolerate the idea
of the child being a criminal. It does not consider
the question of punishment the important
thing. If the child cannot be corrected at home,
for its own good and for the good of society at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
large, it is simply sent to a State public school,
where discipline is superior to that of the home,
and where it is intended to correct waywardness
and to serve as an example to prevent waywardness
in others. The purpose is, in delinquent
cases, to inspire and receive obedience, to improve
and strengthen character. We never release
a boy upon probation until he is impressed
with the idea that he must obey. It is explained
what the consequences will be if he does not obey
and keep his word. It is kindly, but firmly impressed
why all this is so, and why, after all, he
is the one we are most interested in and that it is
for him we are working and not against him. We
want him to work with us and not against us. He
must, to do this, obey in the home, in the school,
and of course, he must obey the laws of the land
and respect the rights of others. We must know
that he obeys. We know this by reports from the
school, signed by the teacher, every two weeks;
by reports from the neighborhood, when necessary
to investigate, and frequently, by reports
from the home, and, in exceptional cases, visits
to the home. And more important than all this
is the trust and confidence we impose upon the boy
himself through the administrative work of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Court. We arouse his sense of responsibility.
We understand him as best we can, and we make
him understand us as best we can.”</p>

<p>Nothing could be said or written of the history
of Boyville and the intention of its workers
that could explain the great object in view better
than the above report.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXXVII.</h2>

<p>There is a city ordinance in Chicago which
prohibits fishing in the lakes of the city parks, and
persons caught doing so are treated as trespassers.
No one would blame a boy for wanting to
fish.</p>

<p>A boy, ten years old, left home with line and
hook for one of these artificial lakes. After securing
a pole from the drift-wood near-by, he
sought an inviting spot to fish; and amid the
green bushes, the songs of the birds and the
breeze that brought sunshine to his young heart,
he cast his line into the peaceful uninhabitated
waters.</p>

<p>A protector of the peace, a defender of the
law, saw this little boy fishing in public waters.
While earnestly waiting for a bite the boy was
arrested. He was taken, by the policeman, to the
station. He did not have any friends to give bond
for him, so they locked him up and left him there
all night in a cell alongside of men who were in
there swearing and cursing, using the vilest of
language. He was placed with hardened people
whose association could not be anything but injurious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
to a ten-year-old boy. Next day he was
brought into Police Court, accused of fishing in
the lake, sentenced for violating this great and
important law of the city of Chicago, and sent to
the work-house, to serve a time in the city prison.</p>

<p>This was twenty years ago, and, just such incidents
as this, caused good honest-thinking people
to try to introduce something that would protect
and care for similar cases. Now, the boy who
violates a law is not arrested and placed in jail or
even a Police Station, but under the splendid
Juvenile Court system the boy is brought into the
presence of a judge who has an opportunity of
showing what he would like to do in other courts,
by extending an encouraging hand to the wayfaring
boy.</p>

<p>The boy is greeted kindly and the strange feeling,
which even men and women have under similar
circumstances, is removed. Instead of the
judge looking sternly at the criminal, as has been
too often the custom, thinking, perhaps justly, the
dignity of the law requires it, he kindly explains
to the boy where he has made a mistake, where he
has violated some law; and after gaining the
friendship and confidence of the little offender,
he is placed in charge of a kind-hearted Probation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Officer, who personally looks after the interests
and welfare of the accused. The Juvenile
Court has power to require the boy to go to
school, and the boy is impressed with the fact
that it is for his benefit. Truant boys are looked
after by this method, and the Probation Officer
goes so far as to visit the homes of the boys to
learn their surroundings. This has been the
means of influencing many families to take better
care of their homes and to keep things in a neat
and tidy condition. This has never been accomplished
before by any methods of a legal nature.</p>

<p>With the valuable work of the Juvenile Court
and the Humane societies, together with the self-governing
plan of the Newsboys associations, all
working harmoniously, what must naturally be
expected of the boy? The home is the natural
environment in which to develop a boy in the direction
of true, self-sustaining manhood; and it
should furnish the conditions most likely to bring
about the happiest results, not only to the individual
and the family, but also to the State. When
this fails, as it often does, the Juvenile Court steps
in and the results are wonderful.</p>

<p>Boyville has made itself known to all classes
of citizens, and has attracted intelligent attention
throughout the country. The newsboys have
learned to work together harmoniously, and this
is one of the valuable secrets of human society
that all must learn in order to be successful and
happy. In the auxiliary monthly meetings the
newsboys conduct the business with more decorum

<p>The following interesting talk on “The Evils
of Cigarette Smoking” was part of an address
delivered at one of the Sunday afternoon meetings,
and is well worth the time spent in reading:</p>

<p>“Smoking cigarettes causes both insanity and
the degeneracy that ends in crime. The cigarette
slave is always enfeebled in body, in mind, or in
moral sense, and generally in all three. Whatever
be the cause&mdash;whether it is opium and other
drugs mixed with tobacco, or oil created in the
paper by burning, or the immediate absorption of
the nicotine from the lungs by the blood, to be
lodged in every nerve and brain-cell in the system&mdash;the
fact remains beyond dispute that the
cigarette is a deadly poison.</p>

<p>“It not only deprives the blood of the proper
quantity of oxygen and thus prevents its purification,
but it also loads it with filth, so that the heart
becomes clogged and the delicate convolutions of
the brain, upon which the mind’s attitude toward
intellectual concepts and moral principles depends,
are paralyzed. Cigarette smoking also creates a
perpetual irritation, like unquenchable thirst, in
the nervous system. It sets up a continual discomfort,
a kind of a gnawing in the nerves,
which makes the victim eternally uneasy except
while he is inhaling the poison into his lungs.
The result of all this is, that he lives in a constant
state of nervous excitement, which reacts upon
his poisoned brain and makes him incapable of
serious and consecutive thought. His body is
weary all the time, except when it is being stimulated
by the alcohol which cigarette slaves inevitably
seek and find, and at last cannot do without.
It is a fact that crime and cigarettes nearly always
go together. Prison records show that
criminals, almost without exception, are cigarette
slaves. Such is the history of the cigarette<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
slave, and while, if he is a natural man of good
family history, education, intelligence and ample
means, he may avoid crime, yet he is in eternal
danger. Boys, newsboys, for your own interest
and welfare, for the love you have for your parents,
if you are cigarette smokers, stop it at once.
If not&mdash;do not begin.”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXXIX.</h2>

<p>The question is often asked: “Do you want
us to go out upon the streets and bring those ragged,
dirty boys with us into our churches, and
have them sit in the same pew with us?”</p>

<p>No, indeed, no. Both you and the boys would
be unhappy.</p>

<p>The idea is for you to take an interest in preparing
them for your church. To shove them out
of your way, into the gutter, and say, “they are
only newsboys,” will never bring these boys to
you or into your churches. They are the strayed
sheep.</p>

<p>When upon the street you meet these “dirty
brats,” instead of avoiding them, of paying no attention
to them, say pleasantly, “Good morning,”
and say it in a tone that means you are sincere
and really wish them a very good morning. That
would be easy and a thousand times better than
to throw them money, as you, perhaps, have often
done, to get rid of them, or thinking you have
done them a great act of charity. All this costs
you nothing.</p>

<p>Instead of having in your heart the desire to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
destroy; encourage the desire to rescue, to uplift.
Instead of hating, cultivate love. “Go forth into
the world and seek for light and light is yours.”</p>

<p>If you would learn the secret of real happiness,
mingle with the children. They are messengers
which come to bless.</p>

<p>But you must understand them. They will
teach you things you never knew or dreamed of.</p>

<p>A speaker at one of the auxiliary meetings
asked a boy to give him an illustration of, “who
is my neighbor?”</p>

<p>He answered: “This morning I shoveled off
the snow from the sidewalks in front of our house.
After I got through I went across the street and
cleaned the snow from the sidewalks of a widow
lady. A friend passing asked me ‘why I did it,’
I replied ‘why, she’s our neighbor’.”</p>

<p>We often hear it said that time is wasted in
trying to save these newsboys, not perhaps because
of the boy himself, but because of that
which makes him what he is. It is argued that
his environment, the influences which surround
him from the day of his birth, will make him a
criminal in spite of all we can do.</p>

<p>The Bible holds man responsible.</p>

<p>If you kind reader, believe in God, believe in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
the Bible, you will find the divine law (Ezekiel
XXXIII.) determines your personal responsibility.
“So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a
watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore
thou shalt hear the word at my mouth. If thou
dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way,
that wicked <i>man</i> shall die in his iniquity; but his
blood will I require at thy hand. Nevertheless, if
thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it;
if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his
iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.”</p>

<p>Following down the ages the same responsibility
is required of Christians (James IV-17):
“To him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it
not, to him it is a sin.”</p>

<p>The man who fails to rise above the level of
his own selfish interests is the man to whom these
apply.</p>

<p>The church, at large, today, is like what Napoleon
once said: “The army that remains in
its entrenchments is beaten.” The church remains
mostly in its own entrenchments of conventional
practices and indifference to the unsaved
young men. There is but one remedy for
this present indifferent condition, and that is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
be found in an awakening of consciousness of personal
responsibility for the salvation of the boy.</p>

<p>We need a new doctrine, not a new law, that
will bring people back to the Simple Life that demands
some self-sacrifice.</p>

<p>If we follow these teachings what shall be
our reward?</p>

<p>Do you remember what Pharaoh’s daughter
said when, winning that strange prize from the
bulrushes, on the Nile; she called to the woman
whose child might have perished?</p>

<p>Pharaoh’s daughter said to the mother:
“Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I
will give thee thy wages,” and that message is
given as the crown of all motherhood on whom
the divine mercy falls today. There comes this
same message: “Take this child and nurse it for
me, and I will pay the thy wages.”</p>

<p>The good that you have done you shall know,
“not here, but hereafter.”</p>

<p>We should never forget that the best and
truest lives are those who strew all the years with
the sweet aroma of loving and self-sacrificing
deeds. Did you ever go, in summer, to the great
marshes of our fresh-water lakes, and in the little
bayous, where the muck and grasses are so thick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
it is difficult to even row a boat? If not, it will pay
you to go. You find the white water lilies, dotted
here and there all over this forsaken waste. They
take root and grow silently amid the slime and
mud in the quiet waters, until, in mid-summer,
they open their creamy beauty to the persuasion
of the sunshine, the glory and idealization of all
flowers. So amid the lowest and poorest of humanity,
among its shadows and mists, we can
sow, day by day, our small seeds of gentle and
generous deeds, not knowing when they take root,
or expecting to ever behold their unfolding into
the blossoms on the great river of time.</p>

<p>To have a perfect government we must have
a perfect people, and that cannot be accomplished
unless we educate, unless we train, our boys in
the right direction. If we do our share in this
generation it will be easier for those who follow.</p>

<p>The more you mingle among newsboys the
easier it is to learn how to influence and guide
them in the right path.</p>

<p>They will open out to you a world you have
never found, a world full of sunshine. If you are
inclined to serve these boys, and are willing to
try to teach them how to live right, you will build<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
for yourself a crown of happiness in this world
that all the wealth of a nation cannot purchase.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXXX.</h2>

<p>It is hoped that the preceding pages have
given the reader some idea of the workings of
Boyville, of the self-governing plan carried on
successfully for many years. It has demonstrated
the fact, to the president and his faithful associates,
the trustees, and the officers of the auxiliaries,
that boys can govern themselves, that they can
build up and carry on the work that has usually
been done by older persons. Corporal punishment
is not necessary and no arbitrary authority is
needed. There is nothing compulsory about the
entire work of the association. The simplest
methods are always adopted, keeping in view the
wishes of the boy. Not by advanced theories
that reach beyond the comprehension of the boy,
but by gradually introducing good principles that
have a tendency to uplift the boy, and following
as nearly as possible the lines he is interested in.</p>

<p>Through the ever-willing assistance of the
Humane officers, and later, the splendid work
of the Juvenile Court, the association has been
able to get behind the cause of much of the wrong-doing
of the newsboys, by reaching their parents.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Any good physician, to cure a disease, will make
every effort possible to discover and cure the
cause. There is an old saying: “A stitch in time
saves nine.” This is certainly true and applicable
to work among newsboys. We agree with the
many good things said and written by the late
Samuel M. Jones, and this in particular: “The
only way to help people is to give them an opportunity
to help themselves.”</p>

<p>Our cities are full of boys growing up to manhood
without advice, without help. They are
turned aside to do the best they can, to battle with
life with everything against them. The question
to thinking men today is, shall we permit these
boys to continue on the certain road to ruin, or
shall we turn a few steps out of our way to lend
a helping hand? Shall we wait until they become
confirmed criminals and are serving sentences in
prisons before we try to help them?</p>

<p>It is much easier to save a soul in a healthy
and satisfied, comfortable-feeling body, than in
a body wasted by want and with a mind diseased
by injustice, cruelty and wrong.</p>

<p>The good accomplished by the members of
The Boyville Newsboys’ Association, we hope,
will go on forever, and that this generation may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
prove the best and our people continue to be the
most prosperous, and our boys grow up to be God-fearing,
honest men, is the prayer of every man
and woman of our land. But prayers will never
be answered if we sit with our hands folded waiting
for someone to do the work.</p>

<p>In these hurrying days, when life is becoming
complicated in so many ways; when the love of
money is greater than the love of mankind, you
wonder where can real happiness be found.</p>

<p>Let us kindly suggest a new work, a new field
of labor; a field that may test human goodness
and human ability, but where you will reap more
than riches, more than fame.</p>

<p>Begin today, go out upon the streets, work
among the newsboys, reach down to those below,
and offer a hand to lift them up. Throw around
them the proper protection and influence. In
your own city, your own town, at your own
doors, are acres of diamonds only waiting for
you to help in the work of polishing.</p>

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
